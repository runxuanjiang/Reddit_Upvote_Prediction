9,Dear Professors...,"My grandmother passed away one week ago. You know that, of course, because I emailed you saying so. What you might not know is how much your responses meant to me.

On Tuesday morning, I logged onto a Zoom call with my grandma and a few family members. I thought it was just to say hello. The call dropped shortly after. She passed away.

I cried for two hours straight. Then, I pulled myself together and went to class. I even used the ""raise your hand"" feature and chipped in during discussion. You wouldn't have known anything was wrong. Halfway through, I muted myself, turned off my video, and cried again.

I thought about not emailing you. I'm aware that ""my grandma died"" is a classic excuse. We aren't having a funeral right now because of COVID-19, so I don't have proof. I told you that. Each one of you told me I didn't need it. You said to take my time to process and heal. There is no set timetable for healing, but I think you knew that, too.

You didn't know, however, that ever since my mother's cancer diagnosis during my freshman year, my biggest fear has been losing my loved ones. COVID-19 hasn't helped, especially with having older, high-risk parents (and being high-risk with an autoimmune disease myself). There have been nights when I've cried myself to sleep thinking about it and all the other stresses of the world. 

You can imagine my state of mind, then, when I found out my grandma was admitted to the hospital and passed away shortly after. My grandmother had (falsely) tested negative when we found out she may have been exposed to the virus. It didn't seem fair, as we had very much tried to be careful since March. Of course, I still had classes and homework. I tried to push away the harsh realities and dedicate myself to my studies. 

But it was, and has been, hard. I haven't been able to see family because they are in quarantine. My dad, who was the one caring for my grandma, is isolating and showing COVID-19 symptoms himself. I don't know what's going to happen for the holidays, nor do I even look forward to them anymore. I feel no motivation to get out of bed. The one time I did leave the house to get a book from Shapiro, I teared up on the diag. I keep going back and forth emotionally, listening to my grandma's voicemails and sporadically experiencing the various stages of grief. 

You didn't know how close we were and how much she meant to me. But you didn't need to know that to treat me with compassion. You offered extensions, yes, but also genuine condolences. Several of you wrote fairly long emails. One of you even talked to me about losing your own grandmother when *you* were a student, describing how it was ""incredibly hard, to lose a grandmother at a distance, without the usual ways of connecting and feeling present to process the loss with others."" I think you hit the nail on the head with that one. 

It will take a while for the grief to pass, but in the meantime, thank you for understanding. Thank you for giving me the past week/weekend to Zoom my family instead of you, look at pictures instead of Canvas, and discuss memories instead of lecture notes. 

People have experienced so many different types of losses from COVID-19. Like many others, I've felt financial loss, the loss of a ""normal"" college experience, and now, the loss of a loved one. I've seen the posts by other students this semester and witnessed in the past how strict some professors can be. Quite honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect when I emailed you, but I'm very glad I did. 

It's professors like you that make me say ""go blue."" Thank you.",828,16,uofm,top

14,Farewell Ann Arbor,"As I sit here typically this, I have tears coming down my eyes. After 3.5 years here, tonight I spend one of my last ever as a student here. As I laid awake in my bed at 5am heart broken, I couldn’t stop thinking about all of the places I used to go around campus. All the memories associated with each and every place around this incredible city. Not able to go to bed, I decided to go for a run. Something I used to do regularly 3 years ago as a freshman. I wanted to do as much as possible. See as much as possible. I ran to the Union, spun the cube. I ran across the diag, and to CCLittle where I spent so much of my time here. Considering I won’t get to graduate in Ann Arbor, I walked across the fountain next to the MLB. Something I did on my very first day on campus as a student. Running around central campus brought back a lot of memories... but when I got to North Campus, and started to swing on the swing set, I broke down. People hate on North Campus, but as an Engineer, this place is home. Bursley, the Dude, the volleyball court, the GG Brown, the BBB, EECS. This place has seen some of my very highs, and some of my very lows. I never thought about not being up here this semester, until I sat on that swing set. Oh how much I’ve missed it. Ann Arbor, North Campus, I’ve had an incredible time here as a student. You will be missed. Thank you. Go Blue!",732,14,uofm,top

I initially came back to this account to delete this post because I felt embarrassed about having spilled all these feelings out onto everyone, but when I saw all your kind comments I was overwhelmed with gratitude to be part of this community. I'm feeling so much better now. I hope you are all taking care of yourselves, too!

\*

My students are all understandably miserable or depressed. About a third of them have either been seriously ill or have had to take care of a sick family member. I'm getting assignments in at random times and all my free time feels like it's filled with grading late assignments or emailing students to reassure them that I won't fail them for missing a single class or turning something in late.  I'm not going to have a break because I have to give make-up assessments and grade all the work that has come in at various random times over the semester. Students are doing poorly on the assessments that my supervisor demands we give. The best way for them to do better is to do the work in a timely fashion, come to office hours when confused, and study, but everyone is so burnt out that suggesting that is absurd and my class isn't worth it to them anyway. I go over my attendance rolls and check in on students who haven't showed up in a while, never knowing if the email I get back is going to be about a dead parent or their own hospitalization or if they'll even respond. I create additional opportunities to help students who are missing assignments or whose grades are suffering, but hesitate to send them out because I don't know if I'm reinforcing existing inequalities or if the students I'm specifically targeting actually want the opportunities or just feel harassed.

This job used to give me joy. Now I hate it. I hate forcing students to learn things they don't want to or have the energy to. I've always hated grading but now it brings me dread. I go to bed crying and my sleep is disrupted by nightmares about teaching. Then I wake up, pull myself together, and spend the rest of the day in classes and office hours and grading.

I'm so fucking sorry. I wish I could help you all. I wish there was no grading. I wish this university gave you the education you all deserve and actually emphasized learning rather than treating you as dim-witted creatures motivated solely by the carrot or the stick. I wish I didn't have to worry about if some of my students are stuck at home with shitty parents who hurt them. I wish I didn't have to worry about if some of my students knew where their next meal was coming from. I wish I didn't have to worry about whatever tragedies you have going on in your life that I will never know about, that you didn't feel you had to reveal incredibly personal things to me to get flexibility but also that I wasn't a mandatory reporter who has to tell my students that I'll tattle on them if they tell me anything too serious. This system is garbage and yet I don't know how to escape it.",703,7,uofm,top

36,For those who are struggling: How I nearly got kicked out of the university but ultimately turned my life around and graduated,"Hola, amigos! Congratulations on finishing this semester; I can't imagine how stressful it must have been for you.

It's been a little over a year since I've graduated (December 2018), and since this lockdown's been in place, I've done a bit of reflection on my time at Michigan. In my time in AA, I hit rock bottom, and I had to completely rebuild my life before I began to find success. I'm sharing my story because I hope it can prove helpful for some.

When I moved to Ann Arbor as a freshman in 2012 (I'm dating myself!), anyone might be forgiven if they glanced at my high school resume and pegged me for success:

\- 3.79 GPA, unweighted  
\- 16 AP credits (including taking the AP English test but not the class; my hs only offered 5 AP courses total)  
\- 5 community college courses taken  
\- Multiple scholarships  
\- 35 on the ACT (scored a 28 in 8th grade, the only other time I took it)  
\- 99th percentile on Math and Chemistry placement tests

I realize that these numbers are pretty pedestrian for a place like Michigan, but they serve to emphasize my point. I was a paper tiger coming out of high school, and I was subsequently exposed.

You know what my GPA was as a freshman? 1.42. I ""earned"" a 1.00 during the Winter semester. Between both semesters, I only passed 11 credits.

You know what's funny, though? I was *so close* to doing decently, in retrospect. But I pretty much completely gave up in early November, and that was that. I had a B in Physics 140 at that point, which subsequently tanked (I missed passing by 0.2%). I earned an A on the first two ENGR 101 projects...then just never completed another project again. For weeks at a time during the Winter semester, I literally wouldn't even leave Bursley besides the occasional foray to the NCRB. I didn't attend class. I spent 14 hours a day surfing the internet in my dorm room. It got really bad. I made, like, one *kind of* friend the whole year.

**Some relevant factors which contributed to my struggles as a freshman, roughly ranked from less to more important:**

\- I had my parents take me home every other weekend (hometown's 75 miles west). **Do not do this**. Cut the cord. Learn to live on your own.  
\- My dog became paralyzed in the fall  
\- My grandfather passed away in November  
\- I began to deeply question my inherited religious beliefs (I was raised in an extremely religious household, so they were very important to me)  
\- I had no plan. I didn't know what I wanted out of college. I only went to Michigan because I had told myself my entire life that I would do so.  
\- I failed to responsibly regulate my internet usage, as mentioned above. I literally ate, slept, and surfed the internet for large swaths of the year.  
\- I had **no study skills whatsoever**  
\- I was so afraid of failing that I couldn't bring myself to try. At anything. **I didn't know how to handle adversity**. I spent most of my life before college achieving supposed ""academic success"" without exerting any effort at all. What if I actually *tried* to do well and didn't? That would threaten my pride and my personal identity!

I wish I could say that I learned my lesson, came back my sophomore year as a new person, and never looked back. Obviously, I didn't. My life got worse before it got better. I'm going to briefly sketch my subsequent journey from here on out, **but feel free to skim until the end if you don't want to get lost in the minutia of my journey.**

I moved home and took community college classes in Fall 2013. Took 5 classes and ""earned"" a 3.7 despite literally doing nothing different from my freshman year at UMich. That's community college for you. But I bottomed out again in Winter 2014. I once again gave up on my classes halfway through the semester. *And I would've passed them all if I'd just persisted and shown up to class!!*

I'm not going to take a deep dive into every subsequent semester. I wish I could point to a specific inflection point where I turned everything around, but the truth is, it was a long, slow road, with lots of setbacks along the way. During my two years away from UMich, I realized I had become an atheist (a *huge* deal for me, extremely upsetting,and I literally couldn't bring myself to talk with anyone I knew about it for *years* out of shame) and subsequently lost a chance to date an amazing girl from my high school due to said loss of faith. These are important life factors to mention, because they profoundly affected my psyche for years to come.

I eventually decided to apply for reinstatement at Michigan for Fall 2015. What should've been my senior year had become my sophomore year. I was on probation, and if I didn't pass every class, I would possibly be expelled from the university. I wish I could say I killed it, but honestly? The only major difference between this semester and my first two at UMich: I actually kept going to class every day. That still qualifies as progress. I still only ""earned"" about 20% of the homework points in ChE 230, and I passed Orgo I with a B despite only cramming for about 2 hours the night before each exam. Ended with a 2.9, and received the chance to continue for another semester.

Winter 2016 really tested me. I should've been able to build on the last semester, right? But I didn't even complete a single homework assignment for either of my ChE courses before Spring Break. My Thermo midterm grade reflected this. You know what, though? I couldn't drop the classes because I was still on probation. So I met with my professors, regularly met with my adviser (if you were in ChE, you know how awesome Dr. M is), kept attending class, and showed enough during the second half of the semester to pass all of my classes. Barely. To be completely honest, I think Thermo's the one class in my time at Michigan that I didn't really deserve to pass. I suspect the professor passed me because I met with him a few times, showed at least some improvement, and starting turning in (most) of the homework assignments. I owe him big-time. I earned a 2.5, and finally got off probation.

I told you things would get worse, didn't I?

The Fall 2017 semester began in much the same manner as the prior semester: I didn't attempt a single homework assignment for any of my courses before Fall break. I distinctly recall sitting in Chrysler auditorium during my Heat/Mass midterm and feeling genuinely suicidal for the first time in my life. I vividly remember staring at the whiteboard and imagining driving myself off a bridge instead of driving home for break. I didn't know how to do a single problem on the test, and my resultant 17/100 (lowest score by far in the class) reflected this. But once again, rather than give up on the semester, I kept trying. This time, though, I didn't pass two of my courses. And thus I was once again placed on probation, and relegated to mandatory academic leave for a semester. I also lost financial aid eligibility, a major blow.

Winter 2017 proved to be arguably the uttermost nadir of my life. I wasn't taking classes, I wasn't working, I was staying up until 6:00 am every night and sleeping until 2:00 pm, I had ceased going to the gym, and I hadn't told anyone that I was on probation. I pretty much drifted listlessly for about a month. But I began to slowly make better choices. I eventually signed up for a single transferable Microbiology course at WCC about three weeks into the semester. Still struggled to study, but I passed. Then I took Orgo II at WCC during the summer semester. Met a great professor who did his Master's as a ChE at UMich, and I keep in touch with him to this day. Finally applied for a job, at Kroger, and started in July. The Scholastic Standing Committee reinstated me for one final last-chance semester in the Fall.

Fall 2017 was when my life really began to gain some momentum. I worked 12-20 hours per week, but paradoxically, this forced me to actually become more efficient when I wasn't working. Came down to finals, but I passed all of my classes with a 2.45 overall. Then I earned a 2.82 in the Winter semester (despite a D in a 1-credit 5-week quantum chem course; courses weighted for hw assignments to comprise 30% of your final grade really weren't made for me). And I finally really started to come into my own for my final semester, during Fall 2018. Despite working up to 20 hours a week, and sometimes working 3 am to 11 am on weekends (with a football game in the middle!), I ended up with a 3.2 overall and two A's in my ChE courses. I'm happy to report that I took on a bit of an informal co-leadership role in my senior design team, and I pretty regularly received quality peer reviews in my project-based courses near the end. It took a long time, but I finally looked like I belonged at Michigan.

Even though it took 6.5 years, I finally did it! I *graduated!!*

**Here were the primary factors which eventually contributed to my later successes:**

\- I showed up and kept going to class. Seriously, don't underrate this factor in success; it's a cliche for a reason.  
\- I found people to hold me accountable. My adviser in the ChE program proved instrumental in my journey. For most of my later years at UMich, we met pretty much every other week to track my progress.  
\- I filled my schedule, which forced me to be more productive in my free time. During my last three semesters in which I worked anywhere from 16-24 hours/week, my overall GPA was a 2.82. Not at all noteworthy, but I don't think it's coincidental, either.  
\- I attended office hours and befriended professors. Turns out, people here actually *want* you to be successful, especially if they get to know you a little bit as a person.  
\- I began to take more group-based upper-level courses in my last few semesters. Honestly, it's amazing how being responsible for other people's successes can motivate you. I didn't want to let my partners down.

Again, I don't want to portray my successes as more resounding than they actually were. Even in my last semester, I earned 46% of the homework points in my last lecture-based ChE course. A personal record, unfortunately. Sadly, I could pretty routinely cram for any exam for 2-3 hours beforehand without doing much of any homework, and then score roughly class average. I'm not proud, but that ability did save me a few times. Fall 2017, for example: I stayed up the entire night before my 8:00 am Reactions Engineering final, with the intent to study. I just browsed Reddit all night instead. Still scored 2 points above class average. Then walked into my Heat/Mass final two days afterward, 5 minutes late. I'd crammed for 30 minutes to make a hasty cheat sheet, and that was it. Scored a 48, thought I failed. Then learned that the class average was a 46, and the high score was a 72. 

**Please do not do this, even if you're capable**. It's extremely stressful, and honestly pretty much sucks. When I graduated, I calculated what my GPA would have been if I'd merely performed at class average on hw assignments, ceteris paribus...it wasn't pretty. I would've been dean's list a few times and pretty much broken a 3.0 overall. Not a good realization. Don't be me.

**Insofar as I'm qualified to give advice, here's mine**

\- **Lay down your pride.** You're not that smart compared to your peers at Michigan. You might be a 99th percentile kid by many high school metrics, but so is literally everyone else in your classes.  
\- **If you don't have any study skills, learn them ASAP.** You might have been able to coast by in high school. Unless you're genuinely an exception, you can't get away with that anymore. Yes, I did know some people who could take 20+ EECS credits and 4.0 them without trying, but that's probably not you.  
\- **Attend office hours.** Try it at least once for each of your classes. I treated office hours as non-negotiable for my last couple semesters, since I knew I rarely studied on my own.  
\- **Learn to ask for help if you need it.** I cannot overstate how genuinely empathetic and caring people can be at this university. Your professors *want* you to succeed. Your advisers *want* you to succeed. Your peers (most of them) *want* you to succeed. Just be honest if you're struggling, and you'd be *shocked* at how understanding people can be. I've been given extensions to assignments, and I've had professors re-weight my grade to help me out. People will fight for you. It's crazy.  
\- **Do not pull all-nighters. Ever.** I'm not joking. I've done them, they absolutely suck, and I'm telling you, not a single one of them would have happened had I been responsible and planned ahead on my assignments. And by extension, you really shouldn't need to be putting more than 80 hours/week into school, and even that's extreme. There's more to life than your classes.  
\- **Protect your health.** Your physical health informs your mental health. Please, get outside once in a while. Find some sort of exercise that you can commit to. Get adequate and consistent sleep. Don't eat out every meal.  
\- **Find a friend group.** I'm not an outgoing or sociable person at all. Never partied. Yet even though I've been an atheist since 2015, I actually regularly attended a weekly Bible study since I returned to Michigan. I made some great friends this way, played on some fun IM teams, and if not for that group, I probably wouldn't have made many other friends. Seriously, there are 20,000+ undergrads. Potential friends are out there.  
\- **Be kind to yourself.** It's okay if your time at Michigan isn't a resounding success. It's okay if you change majors. It's okay if you take longer to graduate. It's okay if you retake some classes. Life is long, and if you don't kill it here, you've still got your whole life ahead of you. Make the most of it.  
\- **Embrace the possibility of failure**. The only way you can truly fail at Michigan is if you don't try. I learned this the hard way. I realized that my fear of failure constituted my greatest character flaw. And you know what? I decided to make my response to failure my greatest strength. Still a work in progress. (:

Never give up on yourself. I know what it feels like to lose hope in life, to feel like you're a complete failure. I know what it's like to give in to despair, to feel like no company would ever hire you, like no person would ever date you. It's awful, it really is. I don't wish it on anyone. But there is hope for you, if you're willing to try.

My greatest accomplishments in life have consistently resulted from disciplined, consistent, applied effort. To wit:

\- I started lifting about 10 years ago, and now I'm one of the biggest people at the gym.   
\- I started writing a poem every single day in 2014, and now I've got 8 self-published volumes to show for it. I even won 2nd prize (and $3000) in a writing competition for UMich engineers last year, and I find that particularly moving, given that most of [said poems](https://studentawards.engin.umich.edu/poetry/winningpoems/) were written during the winter months of 2017, the darkest period of my life.  
\- I graduated with a 2.23 GPA from Michigan. Yes, I am *proud* of that number, because I actually fought for it. It means so much to me.

If I can fail so miserably, so can anyone. But if I can recover from my failures, so can anyone. I really believe that. If you're struggling, please know that you're not alone. You're not a bad person. Michigan is a challenging place.

I hope my experiences prove helpful to some of you. I certainly don't pretend to have all the answers. If any of you are struggling and need someone to talk with, I'd be happy to dialogue. I'm still in AA, and I still work out at one of the campus gyms (whenever they re-open! Haha). As a direct result of my struggles, I've become very passionate about helping other people. So if you want to talk school, or life, or lifting, or writing, just hit me up. I've been given so much by so many amazingly selfless people throughout my life, and it's the very least I can do to pay it forward and help others. (:

Best of luck to all of you, and vamos azul!!

**TL;DR:** I failed spectacularly at UMich, but turned it around. These are the lessons I learned the hard way.

40,I got rejected from UM PhD program and I was admitted to psych ward,"Hi all, I finally have the courage to post this. I'm a current UM student. I absolutely love UM and I wanted to continue my PhD study here. The professor who I wanted to work with wrote a strong recommendation letter for me, which made me feel it was promising to get in. But the program rejected me anyway.

Several hours after I received the rejection decision I had an appointment with my primary care physician. I was hurting so much that I couldn't stop crying in front of him. “I've tried my best, but in the end everything just doesn't matter” - that’s the only thought on my mind at that moment. He asked me if I was going to hurt myself. I said yes, without knowing the consequences of admitting that I felt suicidal. He sent me to the UM Hospital Psychiatric Emergency Service. I was interviewed by several staff. They decided to transfer me to a mental health unit of another hospital, aka. the psych ward. They kept me waiting in a chair from 6PM to 8AM the next day because no beds were available. I was transferred by an ambulance to the psych ward. Everyone there was seeing me as a breaking news. ""Wow we got a UM student here!” “Why would UM student be committed to the psych ward?"" ""UM students should be smart enough to navigate life crisis."" While I surely didn’t feel I belonged there, I felt I had nowhere to go.

During the whole week while I was hospitalized, the staff took away all my personal belongings, including my phone and laptop. In other words, they cut off all my contact with the outside world. I could not text my friends, check my emails, or work on anything. I was begging for some books to read, but they didn't provide any. All they asked me to do was laying in my bed. So I lay in the bed crying for the whole week, missing my friends and missing myself - the self who dreamed to be a researcher.  You might be thinking the psychiatrist should be able to help me. The truth was that as long as I revealed any negative emotions or vulnerabilities, the psychiatrist would delay the discharge. I desperately wanted to get out of there and have my freedom back. So I pretended that I was perfectly fine, asking for a reevaluation and begging her for a discharge. Nevertheless, she kept me there for a week. I was diagnosed with depression.

You might be wondering why is getting rejected from a PhD program hurting so much. The answer is that I'm an international student. I depend on visa to stay here. My researcher personality means that I’m not suitable for real-world jobs. And it's really hard for international students to find a research assistant position without being in the F-1 status. The consequence of not being able to stay in the US means that I have to go back to my home country, dealing with my abusive family and the authoritarian regime. Furthermore, I would not be able to find a research position there because my research area is forbidden in my home country due to its politically sensitive nature. So I thought about taking my own life. But don't worry, I have been taking antidepressants for half a month now and I'm mentally stable.

I'm posting this because this is the most terrifying experience of my life. I'm terrified of the US mental health care system. The UM Hospital Psychiatric Emergency Service and the psych ward were very demeaning, apathetic, abusive, and retraumatizing. Because they are under the guise of medical treatment, they can easily commit human rights violations without getting caught or having proper litigation. This experience just discourages me from seeking help for mental health in the future. Someday I might feel really suicidal, but I wouldn't tell anyone because I'm afraid of being sent to the psych ward again.",606,18,uofm,top

Ever since the talks began about graduate students going on strike, I've noticed a massive shift in this subreddit. Throwaway accounts are cropping up, which have been used exclusively for the purpose of making fun of the union members. [Example](https://www.reddit.com/user/quinn_thee_eskimo70) [the post in question](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/ip0wj8/go_to_work/). Polls people on this subreddit have done have been wildly inconsistent about solidarity to the union [[1](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ioh61m?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=uofm&utm_content=t3_ioh61m)], [[2](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ioxup8?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=uofm&utm_content=t3_ioxup8)]. Unprovoked, highly aggressive posts are being made that attack other users, such as this [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/ioiv1w/thinking_about_sneaking_into_michigan_stadium/g4fu2le/) where someone insulted another student's parents and said they should resign from law enforcement, [second example here](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/ioiv1w/thinking_about_sneaking_into_michigan_stadium/g4etmtm/). Accounts posting official UMich statements, then turning around to make fun of grad students, [citation](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/ioehi3/official_umich_statement_on_geo/g4diw5q/). Accounts that are [encouraging police brutality](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/iobpme/geo_has_voted_to_stop_work_ie_strike/g4eslbb/) against the strikers. Claims of ""vandalism"" going on because of strikes, when in reality it's only chalk or paint that can wash off [citation](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/iovej7/no_less_than_50_yards_away_from_a_geo_protest/). The same account in the previous example making more [claims of vandalism, but without any evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/iotyn7/im_sure_vandalizing_campus_buildings_is_really/). 

This is not what /r/uofm is. We've never been this way, but *something* about the strikes has triggered an influx of brigading on this subreddit. Before the news of the strike hit, the vast majority of posts were being upvoted, even if it was something like a minor question. Now, posts seem to be getting indiscriminately downvoted for no reason, while extremely hostile and threatening comments are receiving significant upvotes. Some group seems to be targeting this subreddit to sow dissent, whether it's administration, 4chan, aliens, or whatever - doesn't matter. The point is, it feels like we're being brigaded.

Whether you support the strikes or not is your own opinion, that's not what this post is about. My only point here is that there's something *incredibly fishy* going on with posts, that makes me think some of the people (and throwaways) that have been coming here may not actually have any relation to the school whatsoever.

81,A plea to the undergraduates,"Dear undergraduates,

&#x200B;

I'm sure you're feeling a wide range of emotions about coming back to campus this fall, including, of course, excitement about seeing your friends again and being back on campus (and probably some trepidation because of the global pandemic). As someone who permanently lives in Ann Arbor and is employed by the University, I can tell you that many of us permanent residents are feeling nervous. 

You see, I have rode my bike and walked past neighborhoods that are dominated by undergraduates, and I've already witnessed, over the summer, a number of big, non socially-distant parties. I completely respect that you want to enjoy your college days but unfortunately decisions like these have a broader impact than you realize.

Please, please, please as you begin to move back to campus, please consider that even if you don't get visibly sick, you can pass it on to others as an asymptomatic (or pre-symptomatic) carrier. Faculty, graduate students, and staff are employees, and so are going to be asked to do their jobs and show up and interface and use the same equipment and entryways as you, but don't have the choice not to. Please realize that we are *relying* on ***you*** to make smart choices. ***If you don't feel well -*** **please don't leave your dorm/home. Please quarantine. Please don't go to parties. Please, for the love of all that is good, do not go to class (I promise your professor would rather not be exposed to COVID-19 than give you makeup work).**

You may feel that you are invincible from this virus because you are young and healthy and I am sure you have plenty of news sources to give you the facts so I won't try to stuff them down your throat. Just please remember that the more you throw giant parties, 

**a)** the faster school gets shut down - because if there is an outbreak on campus, you will almost certainly all be sent home again, 

**b)** the more instructors and employees are at risk, 

**c)** the more likely one of you or your friends ends up in the ICU and/or dies, 

**d)** the more caseloads you create for our essential employees who are working their hardest to keep all of us safe and alive (in addition to trying not to get sick themselves). 

I implore you to consider celebrating your return to campus with your friends in a safer, more socially distant way. If you have to have parties (which I'd prefer you didn't but recognize you want to enjoy college), have smaller group parties. Wear masks. Stay outside. Don't share drinks. Please be responsible. We are counting on you.

&#x200B;

Thank you for hearing my desperate plea.

82,An RAs POV,"hello, Im an RA in a freshman dorm & with all the events going down right now I thought it would be helpful to pass along information of what I see. Though before I begin I would like to share that its against the social media contract we signed to post anything negative about our position/university/housing etc so i have to keep things sort of vague/neutral to protect myself & other people on staff. My experience is also not representative of all other RAs, as it also depends on what building/how efficient that buildings staff group is.

\-The RAs were allowed to move into the dorms between Aug 12th - Aug 18th. I moved in near the beginning of this allotted time. From my interactions with facilities, It doesnt appear that facilities staff were notified that the RAs were beginning their move in earlier this year(the surprised look of a facilities staff when i walked in and asked for my key). During this time, my communal bathroom hadn't been cleaned since march(smell & appearance), there were items that were strewn across the floor(of the entire building) that the residents from the previous year had left behind(cloths, bottles, mirrors). During the week of resident move in, my communal bathroom was cleaned once. 

\-The RA training included canvas modules. Each module had document review & videos. The majority of the canvas videos did not work(inaccessible and/or access denied). The training included an incredibly short module about COVID-19 precautions. There were(and still) no written guidelines on how to approach residents who refuse to wear masks. I would say these trainings wernt helpful/inadequate to prepare new RAs for this years position. If it wernt for the returners in my building staff, I probably would've quit by now.

\-My building doesnt have any Community Center Assistants(CCA) who are paid to help with logistics like sorting mail, packages, etc. Most buildings are short on staff(RAs & CCAs). There is currently a backlog of unsorted mail. So far, we have not been given any instruction on what to do regarding mail.   We were told by a staff member that it is unrealistic to expect any CCAs to be added. 

\-In addition to the RAs staffing the CC in their native buildings, there are also RAs that have been assigned to work in multiple CCs across different buildings. This seems to contradict the no-guest policy the university is asking us to enforce.

\-The enforcement of wearing a mask at all times in buildings seems to vary greatly depending on the DPSS officer. On one concering end, I have seen a DPSS officer ignore a group of residents in the building who were all not wearing masks. 

\-I am unsure about other buildings, but so far EHS/UHS doesnt notify staff about any quarantined(pending results) students in my building. The only communication that have been received by staff is quarantined with positive results. I learned from word of mouth that there were a few kids that were sent to quarantine. I was subsequently instructed to not spread/talk about it. 

\-From information passed along from students who were sent to quarantine & tested negative: Students are met by DPSS and given 15 minutes to pack their things for a \~2 week stay in quarantine housing. Students in quarantine do not have access to laundry machines. Multiple students who didn't  time to pack enough clothes had to cycle through dirty laundry. Students are given cold food(including meats) without accommodation or alternatives. There were also no means to heat up meals in quarantine housing. Some students opted to pay out of pocket for food to avoid this. 

\-Overall most residents are very diligent about wearing masks during daylight hours(besides a few, of course). This sentiment does a 180 after the sun goes down. Residents dont wear masks when traversing the halls at night to using the restroom/brushing teeth/ showering/late night trips to the vending machine. Larges groups of residents coming back from parties/bars do not have masks or are so intoxicated that the mask is worn improperly.

This is all i have for now, if anyone has any questions ill try to answer in the comments/editing.",499,10,uofm,top

85,University of Michigan is going to join Harvard and MIT in suing to block ICE,"The University of Michigan will sue the Trump administration over its July 6 [guidance](https://www.michigandaily.com/section/government/%E2%80%98immensely-misguided-and-deeply-cruel%E2%80%99-ice-modifies-exceptions-non-immigrant) forcing international students to leave the United States if their college only offers online classes in the fall. The University will join Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology [lawsuit](https://www.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/content/sevp_filing.pdf) as a [friend of the court](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/amicus_curiae), University spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald confirmed in an email to The Daily Thursday. The University’s brief could be filed as soon as Friday. 

Public Policy dean Michael Barr hinted at the move in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/michael_s_barr/status/1281077700329906179?s=21) supporting international students early Thursday morning.

“We’re going to join other Universities in suing to block this arbitrary ICE guidance, which serves no legitimate governmental purpose and penalizes our international students, who so enrich our educational community,” Barr wrote. 

The lawsuit, filed against the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Wednesday in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, alleges the new guidance is “arbitrary and capricious” in its removal of emergency COVID-19 exceptions for F-1 students taking online classes. 

The lawsuit argues the guidance fails to consider the effects on universities that have been planning for months for the 2020-2021 year, as well as the “devastating effects” on international students caught in limbo. It also states that the guidance’s “lack of any real justification” means it could have been implemented to compel universities to change their fall plans. The guidance from DHS was announced hours after Harvard University released its plan for an all-online semester. 

The lawsuit says the July 6 guidance threatens to force many international students to withdraw from Harvard and MIT, forcing both schools to make an “impossible choice.” 

“Lose numerous students who bring immense benefits to the school or take steps to retain those students through in-person classes, even when those steps contradict each school’s judgment about how best to protect the health of the students, faculty, staff, and the entire university community,” the lawsuit reads. 

On March 13, ICE [announced](https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2020/Coronavirus%20Guidance_3.13.20.pdf) international students attending a school that temporarily switches to remote instruction due to the pandemic will retain their visa status. The March 13 guidance indicated the provision would remain “in effect for the duration of the emergency.” The lawsuit points out that President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration has not been rescinded and COVID-19 cases have reached [record highs](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) in recent weeks. 

University President Mark Schlissel [wrote](https://president.umich.edu/news-communications/statements/statement-on-homeland-security-policy-affecting-international-students/) Tuesday the guidance does not interfere with the University’s plans for a hybrid fall semester. However, he wrote the University opposes “arbitrary restrictions” on international students. 

“Even with this initial review that shows a less direct impact on our students, we agree with the statement from the Association of American Universities – of which U-M is a member – that calls this policy ‘immensely misguided and deeply cruel to the tens of thousands of international students who come to the United States every year,’” Schlissel wrote.

According to the University’s International Center [website](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/planning-fall-term-2020-new-dhs-procedures-and-u-m-updates), international students must take at least one in-person class under the new guidance. The Registrar’s office and schools and colleges are working to finalize course instruction modes by Aug. 7, after which students will be allowed to adjust their schedules to fulfill their immigration requirements. 

The International Center website said the new guidance would only force international students out of the United States if the University transitioned to online only instruction before Nov. 30.  

“The only scenario in which we make such a switch is if we have severe COVID occurrence in our community and it is deemed absolutely necessary to go online only,” the website reads.

The University is also working on reissuing I-20 documents to international students with a statement confirming it is not online-only for the fall.

Dozens of other [universities](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/08/harvard-mit-visa-rule-international-students-352448) have announced their intent to file briefs in favor for the lawsuit as of Thursday.

98,Notes on the RA Town Hall Shitshow,"My notes from the RA Town Hall meeting tonight, which... she got messy, and for good reason. Putting these here specifically because the meeting was not recorded and this impacts those living in dorms as well as those working there. The dorms are part of our community and, frankly, they are a high-outbreak-potential location and could shut down campus just as easily as offcampus activities.

**Getting into it**

The meeting, which was asked to be recorded and subsequently declined, consisted of \~5-10 members of leadership staff/team (LT) and approximately 100+ RAs, the majority of whom were anonymous.

The meeting, prepended by a 2-3 page letter of clear actionable items, was scheduled to be from 7pm to 8pm, the first 30 minutes, unexaggerated, were spent on lengthy and unwanted bibliographies of the leadership staff. Students were asked to send messages to LT to be selected and responded to. At 7:45, realizing the entire call had largely been wasted with nonanswers, student staff began unmuting to request additional meetings or extensions to the meeting, marking the tipping point, afterwhich student staff proceeded to collectively drag the leadership/admin team for 45 minutes straight for nonanswers to clear action items provided in the prior letter. It was an interesting impression for the first night on the job for our new Director of Housing, Rick Gibson. 

**And so commenced the 45 minute long dragging of UMich Housing Admin in C-Minor...**

*which they tried to escape saying that ""people seem to be hopping off of the call,"" stoking the still-over-100-person-call back into a flaming shit cyclone*

**Nonconcern for Student Staff:** Graduate housing staff members spoke to shortages of PPE and resident neglect of policy during the summer, as well as having made consistent communications to housing regarding their concerns, which were ignored. RAs were concerned with the structure of being On Duty // On Call, and the requirements to navigate every accessible area of their building during Rounds for 2-3 times per night, putting them in ""every area we could possibly get coronavirus from"" and feeling insecure about protections. Concerns were echoed about the need to intervene during dorm parties, which could include dense clusters of mask-free, intoxicated, judgement-impaired individuals, and resulted in calls to revisit the structure of RA on Duty obligations.

**Nonconcern for Accountability?:** A staff member indicated in their training module that they were not to enforce the no-guest policy unless raised as an issue by other residents. Questions were asked about punitive enforcement of policy, towhich admin responded that they would continue pursuing ""restorative justice,"" which was then also dragged as woefully undereffective at damage control and harm prevention due to focusing on post-incidental restoration and education. One admin mentioned housing contracts could be suspended under noncompliance, but no answers were provided regarding publishable/transparent, standard, structured punitive policy. 

**Retaliation Concerns**: Administrative staff repeatedly expressed discomfort with the sheer degree towhich most student staff were on the call anonymously, unable to see the faces behind the complaints. This came up 3-4x. Each time, student staff reminded of the provision in the LOA / staff contract that indicates staff can be terminated for vocally criticizing any act of policy pushed by Housing. There were shoutouts to those on staff reliant on the position to combat food and housing insecurity, as loss of the job providing both could dramatically destabilize their entire lives, including requests that Housing provide assurance that, even in the event of a campus evacuation as experienced in last winter, RA staff could remain in housing out of necessity for those individuals.

**Protection & Cleanliness:** There are not going to be plexiglass barriers up in the bathrooms. Also, staff members provided two masks, which must be, by policy, washed immediately after use, are insufficient for those working chronically during move-in week. RA's expressed concerns about cleanliness standards of the buildings, noticed during their move-in, towhich admin responded that there were involuntary furloughs of facilities staff, seemingly lending credibility to a discussed rumor of a building with half-capacity cleaning staff.

**Hot Quotations:**

*(Disc: Some of these are paraphrased a word or two due to inability to record the meeting, things moving quickly, and distracting ""oh shit they went there"" moments)*

""Be aware that tonight RAs on Duty will be in building without PPE. We will be in every area we could possibly get coronavirus from. Every floor, every hall.""

""A close friend is an RA in a building recently shut down. She was asked when she would be moving out by facilities before she was ever told be LT or Housing. These decisions directly affecting us and our wellbeing are made without informing us.""

“In housing we are always told to do things quick quick quick quick quick. But when we ask from you \[admin\], it doesn’t seem a priority. Even with life and death on the line.”

""This is happening. Now. It's 8. We're on duty. Are you willing to commit to another meeting this week?""

""You mention residents separately, as if RA's are not residents when we too are moving into these spaces that are not clean.""

""It's infuriating when we come into an hour meeting with expectations that are not met in any way, shape, or form for the first 45 minutes.""

""I request the second meeting start with going point-by-point through our letter, addressing each question, and the second half set for our questions. Also I am disappointed that the first half meeting was introductions and the last half has been us asking question after serious question with no answers by LT, which is frustrating..."" (regarding the degree to which, as serious questions were offered, administrative staff sat very largely in silence the entire second half of the call)

""Our online training module explicitly told us not to enforce the no-guest policy unless a resident raises the issue of the policy being violated. If that is the stance that Housing is taking ... "" 

And multiple instances of being asked for a simple yes-or-no response, zero of which ever resulted in a yes-or-no response. ""To save time, can you PLEASE tell us if any of the action items from our letter will be met. Yes or no? Just- will they be met?""",473,4,uofm,top

100,COVID-19 Updates from an RA,"Not sure if everyone is still interested, but pretty much every RA I know is freaking out about the covid situation right now so here are some updates that we're seeing that everyone else might not know about.

* There are so many transports from campus to quarantine/isolation housing that DPSS literally doesn't have the capacity to transport people in a timely manner. We had an RA who was scheduled to go to quar/iso at 2pm and didn't get to actually go until midnight, and they only got to go then because when DPSS called and said they were waiting to transport them until the next morning and they said ""no"". 
* Contact tracing for the public health notices is taking 8-10 days, which means RAs and residents don't know that someone was confirmed positive until over a week after they may have moved out of the dorm. The contact tracers know pretty much right away when someone is positive, but refuse to tell us until they've completed the entire contact tracing process for anyone that person may have interacted with. Since the contact tracing process takes a while, we pretty much have no accurate idea as to what is currently happening on our floors. We don't know why we don't get notified after the initial positive test is confirmed.
* The Maize and Blueprint is frequently wrong. We don't know how wrong, or whether or not they're actively faking numbers, but we suspect that the 42% number reported Monday was actually an accurate take on how many people were in quarantine/isolation housing, and they've just dragged that number out over the past few days to make it seem less shocking. We think they would justify this by saying they hadn't contact traced everyone on the dashboard at that point, and they updated it as they traced people. We can't know for sure on that, but we know that in the past they've been reporting erroneous numbers so we don't feel like we can trust the numbers now. We've also heard Baits is full, which would indicate higher numbers than they're reporting.
* Conditions in quar/iso housing still suck. Residents that are up there can walk around, invite people over, and even leave. Some of them have been partying. Residents are not tested before they're sent back to the dorms. They're sent back based on whether or not they have a fever and whether or not they have enough symptoms.
* RAs and students in areas across campus are being told to stay in their dorms for two weeks and only leave to go to the bathroom and get food. There's clusters in almost every main dorm. All of Markley has to be tested. If you haven't been checking the housing dashboard (because it was cleverly hidden deep in the housing website) you can check it here: [https://tableau.dsc.umich.edu/t/UM/views/HousingQuarantineBuildings/IsolationandQuarantineHousingStatusbyBuildingHeatmap?%3AshowAppBanner=false&%3Adisplay\_count=n&%3AshowVizHome=n&%3Aorigin=viz\_share\_link&%3Atoolbar=no&%3Aembed=yes#3](https://tableau.dsc.umich.edu/t/UM/views/HousingQuarantineBuildings/IsolationandQuarantineHousingStatusbyBuildingHeatmap?%3AshowAppBanner=false&%3Adisplay_count=n&%3AshowVizHome=n&%3Aorigin=viz_share_link&%3Atoolbar=no&%3Aembed=yes#3) It shows the exact number of students from each dorm in quar/iso housing each morning. It's much more accurate than the Maize and Blueprint, and updates at 5am every day. Right now Markley has 67 people in quar/iso, South Quad has 43, and West Quad has 33.
* As all of this happens, we're being told our dining halls and common spaces are going to be opened. Opening dining halls goes directly against the CDC guidelines. It's so insane to spend your entire day worrying about your residents and trying to coordinate things to help them, and then interact with professional housing staff who are going about their business as if nothing is wrong. VP Harmon is supposed to meet with ResStaff from every dorm and refuses to meet with them virtually, so even as cases are rising we're being pressured to meet in person. We're joking that professional staff is competing across dorms to get the most covid cases, but it sometimes seems like they genuinely want that. The reasoning behind so many of their decisions makes no sense.

Things are bad. They're getting even worse. There's a constant sense of impending doom and all I can think about all day is the covid situation on campus and in my dorm. Something is going to happen soon. We don't know what, if they're going to send us home or put us on lockdown or whatever they think would help, but we're all feeling it. People could get seriously sick or die, and it's not just about whether a resident will get sick and die, but about whether they'll get sick and have lung/heart complications for the rest of their lives.

There are nine RAs from Markley in quar/iso right now. RAs are quitting, and if they're not, the only thing keeping us here is the fact that WE seem to be the only people pushing for actual safety measures in the dorms. No joke, on Tuesday dorms tried to start opening dining halls and indoor spaces. We're in a state of emergency on campus right now, but no one knows we are because administration is pretending we aren't and refusing to acknowledge it.

We're trying our best, and working as hard as we can behind the scenes to improve conditions as much as we possibly can. These aren't even all the issues we're dealing with right now, I only listed the ones I thought were relevant to everyone on campus. Every day we talk to upper housing and try to work on these issues, and we actually have succeeded in having the dining halls and spaces opening paused. But as hard as we're working, we still aren't making progress as fast as we could have. I wish we had stayed on strike longer and gotten better concessions to keep campus safer. I'll stay as long as students are here, and I promise we're going to keep trying to help. But others should know the sense of panic and emergency we're feeling, because cases are spreading faster than we can figure out ways to stop them.

Again, something is going to happen.  Don't be fooled when you watch Schlissel's little update tomorrow and he says everything is fine and we're only testing out of an 'abundance of caution' and we're sooo 'health informed'. We're a flaming dumpster fire. Things need to change NOW, or we're all fucked.",479,14,uofm,top

103,"When the dining halls open for dine in, don’t go - a dining employee","Listen, I know it’s getting colder and I know it’s a headache and it’s lonely to take your food back to your room, but please, please, don’t eat in the dining halls. Opening the dining rooms wasn’t discussed with the student staff, and we haven’t been presented with any kind of plans on how we’re supposed to protect ourselves or the customers. 

More people spending more time indoors because of the weather is exactly what the epidemiologists have predicted to make cases rise. Every week I already get more and more emails about cases in the dorm I work in. We all know by now that the university is ignoring rising case numbers, but this will actively make it worse. Several of my coworkers have made the decision to quit over this. I personally am not in a financial position to do that, but I’m extremely upset about it. This is why I’m making this post. 

And it’s not just the young student staff. Behind the scenes in the kitchen are full time, older employees with families. We are likely going to be expected to clean up after every single student, which is going to be a problem with the understaffing issues. Testing is also not readily available to dining employees without symptoms or close contact. But this school is such a joke that I’m honestly expecting to go the entire semester without being tested. 
 
Student dining staff don’t have a union, so we’re honestly kind of powerless to stop this. But you, the students with meal plans, can be responsible and keep countless people safe. The university’s plans are not safe for you, and are not safe for us. 

Please don’t eat in the dining halls.",488,25,uofm,top

122,"Two Student Suicides During Finals Week, Crickets from UM Administrators","Nothin to see here, just two suicides during finals week while hundreds of students turned to reddit/groupme/piazza/discord to cry about the collective trauma of the eecs and math exams. 

Umich actively and intentionally fosters this hyper competitive atmosphere then tries to blow smoke up our ass about self-care and how grades aren't everything. The most they'll ever do is refer you to defunct resources to soothe their conscious and take the onus off the university and specific STEM departments to come up with actual institutional changes. Course staff and professors justify it by the fact that they took the same course, so it must be ok to keep doing it that way. They infantilize us and minimize our experience every chance they get. When students speak up we don't always need you to answer our concerns and solve all our problems, sometimes we need you to fucking listen! We are intelligent adults too, we do not need a 19 year old IA to tell us about hard times and ""how to get through"".

Last year there was much more of an understanding environment, and they are missing a lot of chances to improve and create a more equitable, accessible learning experience. We put hyper productivity on a pedestal and ignore so many contributing factors to that productivity being just proxies for many forms of privilege. Some of us are taking the same exams as you when we don't have money for basic necessities, we are working ourselves to death, and being conditioned to base our self-worth on some arbitrarily curved grading scale and whether a fucking autograder software gives us enough blue rectangles. I love the topics and content of my classes but the culture here sucks, and is tailored to advantage students based on how well they fit certain molds. The IA's and GSI's are overworked and impatient, and it's a flawed system how much leadership we expect them to take in classes with hundreds of students. The line separating social/peer interactions and professional/academic interactions between students and their instructors becomes overly blurred, further disadvantaging students who are shy or isolated or feel like they don't fit in, and creating an academic caste system by holding up these students for all to see as shining examples of overachievers. 

The school can do better than this, they need to read the room better as to where their student body is at and be more understanding about how national and global events are impacting people, then respond with more support than a fucking table with free granola bars in the BBB.

Strong condolences to these students' friends and loved ones, and because very little information has been released regarding their circumstance I don't know if my specific feedback is applicable or related but I needed to make what is to me an obvious connection.

   
 

Note: I am an upperclassman in EECS with a high GPA and a job lined up, I did well on finals and am in a good spot mentally so I don't want this to be misinterpreted as a cry for help from me. This is my honest feedback on the issues addressed above, which are affecting thousands of fellow students at this school.",459,19,uofm,top

127,You’ll ultimately be thanking GEO for bringing attention to the serious issues with Michigan’s COVID “plan”,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on here from people complaining about GEO’s entitlement and complete disregard for undergrad education. I know there has been a fair amount of controversy over GEO’s demands concerning defunding the police, so I’ll focus my post on the university’s problematic COVID-19 plan. 

From how I see it, those complaining have perfectly legitimate concerns about losing out on their education, especially after paying tens of thousands in tuition fees. Yet here’s the thing: none of that will matter if/when there’s a huge outbreak on campus. At that point, the disruption will be far greater than a GEO/RA strike, and your health will be at risk as well. 

Our university is barely testing at all, and has made no effort to punish students flouting social distancing rules. It’s only a matter of time before spread within the community reaches an uncontrollable point. What makes this worse is that relevant concerns have been brought to the admins by GEO, the RAs and other parties again and again. All the university did in these cases was pay lip service to the demands laid out. 

We are in the middle of a pandemic right now. If Michigan is going to bring back 40,000 plus students to campus, then they should be testing us all twice a week at the very minimum. They should be well prepared to accommodate students in quarantine housing, and have social distancing rules well enforced on and off campus. Keep in mind that even with these measures, there’s no guarantee that major outbreaks would be avoided. We’re not even doing that. 

In the face of inevitable disaster and an administration that is completely delusional (no testing = no cases!), GEO has bravely gone on strike. Not because they’re entitled academics, but because they have exhausted every other avenue of raising these concerns. Schlissel, Ernst, and the rest of the admins are negligent in their handling of this in-person semester. Given the high stakes, I believe it is perfectly understandable for the grad students to strike. How else will they get the higher-ups to understand the gravity of their mistakes?

Lastly, please remember that the virus situation is “all good” until it isn’t. I am sick and tired of seeing comments about how great we’re doing because of our low case count. It takes time for the virus to secure a foothold in a community. In the absence of proper measures to mitigate spread, it’s only a matter of time before positive cases accelerate to the point where campus will need to be shut down. 

It’s definitely hard to fully understand the danger of COVID-19 when it’s not affecting you, but we should be well aware that all of us are vulnerable. Again, we should be thanking GEO for bringing much needed attention to the university’s horribly inadequate plan. Don’t shoot the messenger.",489,60,uofm,top
128,"It's over, Campus Connector","I'm sorry, this isn't working out. I really needed you during Covid and the lockdowns, but ever since the vaccine rollouts and being back in school, things just haven't been the same. I've decided to get back with my first, Commuter North. He was there for me in the beginning, and even though he went away for a while, I can't deny my feelings for him. He's coming back and I'm going to give him another chance.

Honestly, our relationship has been a very bumpy ride. You were never there when I needed you, and you were always getting around with strangers. It really bugged me how you were always gone on the weekends too... did you ever think about how I felt standing in the rain for hours? I felt stranded, with nowhere to go. And you weren't there for me. Plus you've been ghosting me on MagicBus for a while, like wtf is up with that?

Commuter North can take me places that you never could. He also has a hot twin brother--Commuter South-- and I hate to say this, but they are both longer than you, and the rides last waaaay longer😏. I hope you understand. Maybe you could if you weren't NOT IN SERVICE.

If even ONE person had the potential of getting sick no or dying because of their decision to return to in-person classes, returning to campus shouldn't have even been an option on the table. The virus is new, and we don't know the long-term implications of contracting the sickness. Some articles are saying that the long-term health problems could be more severe then we yet know. 

Instead, we get the University proving that they don't care if Umich students and residents of Washtenaw county die because of their decisions, as long as they get their money. I'm disgusted and ashamed of my alma mater.",460,24,uofm,top

181,"I made a native mobile app to track University of Michigan Blue Buses, and I just released it on the App Store and Play Store!","Hello everyone!

You may remember this post from a week or two ago when I was asking for help for beta testing the app. In case you haven't seen that post, here is a quick summary of what the app is.

I am an incoming freshman at Michigan, and I've been living in Ann Arbor for the past 4 years. During that time, I had to use Blue Buses quite often. Since Michigan released the Magic Bus app to replace DoubleMap, I have had some issues with the new app which have led to a frustrating user experience. The following were the most important issues for me.

* No way to see my current location (**This was by far the biggest issue and led me to create this app**)
* WebView UI made gestures feel clunky and unresponsive.
* Not opening straight to the live map.
* Unclear labels and buttons.
* App sometimes just not opening.

Because of these issues, I have created my own application which runs natively on mobile instead of acting as a web wrapper, and remedies the issues I mentioned before.

Now with the quick history out of the way, I just want to thank everyone who participated in beta testing. I have implemented some features that you suggested and the beta testing helped me catch some bugs that would have been very hard to catch otherwise.

Thanks to all of your help, I have finally been able to release M-Bus on both the App Store and Play Store for both Android and iOS. You downloading and using the app means a lot to me, so thank you to everyone who finds the app helpful! Here are the links for each platform.

iOS (App Store): [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/m-bus/id1577013805](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/m-bus/id1577013805)

Play Store: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.efeakinci.mbus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.efeakinci.mbus)

Finally, I want to end with a few things.

First, please know that the app may still have bugs and it may crash. If this happens, please let me know through either the feedback section of the app, or through the contact information on [my website](https://www.efeakinci.com/mbus) so that I can fix it and give everyone a better experience using the app.

Second, if you find the app useful, it would mean a lot to me if you could consider giving the app a rating on the App Store of your choice.

Thank you all for helping me test the app again, and I hope you enjoy using it!

EDIT: Wow! You guys have downloaded and used to app so much that we have exceeded our current limit for API calls today. I will get in touch with U-M transit so that we can hopefully get this limit up. I would also like to give a shout out to past me who thought it would be a really good idea if I set the app up so that it could display important messages in cases like this. Thanks!

187,This is admin's fault.,"The University of Michigan has decided that instead of forming their regulations for this “public health-informed” semester based on the outcomes of other universities, we will instead base it on how adults believe students will behave.

Now, students have been pitted against other students, with the fate of the fall semester allegedly resting on their shoulders. The University’s proposal: all students have to do the right thing at all times for in-person classes.

We’ve been told students aren’t given enough credit for their ability to step up and behave appropriately amid a global pandemic. Students got back to campus and partied. And the University expects RAs, student ambassadors and police to stop them.

Absolutely ridiculous.

We were then told last week that one moment of “letting our guard down” could result in the reversal of our plans for a hybrid semester. But the writing is already on the wall.

It’s easy, in this instance, to go along with that narrative. But it’s completely wrong.

The people who want you to blame fellow students are the same ones who set no repercussions to partying. Who, despite knowing better, said it would be based on trust and a “Culture of Care.”

And here we are. Partying is already happening. We all know how this semester will go. Now we can only hope no one gets seriously sick or dies.

To those who want to blame students: I hear your frustrations. I know we expect students who can get into Michigan to know better. It’s mind-boggling.

But I would also encourage you to think bigger when placing blame. The people are who really at fault here are the ones who created this narrative that we need to blame and patrol our classmates. Who allowed students to come back to Ann Arbor -- endangering an entire city -- with no repercussions for partying when the virus spreads through large groups.

We should hold our classmates accountable to be better, do better. To be the leaders and best. But we can’t do that unless we also acknowledge who set these rules. With all the resources at the school’s disposal, this can’t be the best they could have come up with.

How can we expect students to do better when this is what we’ve been left to work with?",416,31,uofm,top

195,How The Math Department Here Works: A Guide,"# Welcome to Hell

I was originally going to leave this as a comment. However, I decided it would be long and would work better as a post.

TLDR: The (non-financial, undergrad portion) math department is intentionally designed to find students talented in pure math, filter them into extremely difficult and time-consuming classes, and build extremely talented grad students to send to other schools. It is extremely extremely effective at this. It is awful at most everything else.

Some good news before the pain: the department is currently undergoing course restructuring—largely focusing on intro courses. I know the person in charge of this and he is incredible and committed to making it better.

The Goal: Explain to everyone that the University of Michigan Math Department (bar a few professors) does not care about you and how there are a number of professors/grad students/undergrads working to fix that as well as how you can help if you want to. 

I’ll try and quickly describe who I am—as it’s important to know what kind of info I have and why I’m talking about this.

The Perspective: I am an honors math major at Michigan with a lot of connections within the department. I have met with multiple people (non-majors, professors, the chair of the dept, you name it) to discuss and correct the problems in both the intro courses + the math major courses. I’m doing my best but god damn there’s a lot to fix and a tiny fraction of the professors care about this. I also TA/have TA’d for multiple math courses (hi 201,295,297) and do outreach teaching middle schoolers basic arithmetic. It is quite possible i have more teaching experience than most GSIs at this point. I do this because I love teaching and also I need to make rent—I have no one else contributing to my education atm.

# Myth-Busting: Why do GSIs teach 115/116? The Problem of Workload 

This is perhaps the most complained about aspect of 115/116, which I understand. It is where everyone has been trained to look.

But. It doesn’t make sense. I’ve repeatedly talked with the math department about GSIs with little teaching experience being the primary mode of instruction for the majority of students in math classes (aka 115/116 non-majors satisfying a prerequisite). 

They have told me repeatedly it would be cheaper for them to teach in large sections, and they could find professors to do so.

So why GSIs? Well. It works. Kinda.

There is a battery of tests on calculus concepts taken across many calculus sections at many different universities. UMICH calc sections **crush** the competition in these tests. Even when accounting for people having already taken AP Calc.

The reason according to the dept: 115/116 is taught in small sections. This may be true. I have no idea whether it’s more effective, though I suspect it is

The reason I believe: 115/116 are extremely work heavy and hard classes, even If you’ve taken calc already. It shouldn’t be this way, but it is, and it does make you better at calculus.

How this squares with everyone’s awful experience: There is so much work in these classes that it is very easy to drown. Even if you are learning a lot, you constantly feel behind and stressed over your grades. GSIs are unable to provide help for the biggest problem: workload. It is so hard to teach someone who is caught behind bc of difficult workload. I experience this problem in all of my teaching jobs. 

A solution: Lower the workload and require more training for GSIs, assigning them a math major course to TA for one term at least before TAing 115/116, or requiring them to work with local high schools in some capacity. Students will learn more when they are less stressed and GSIs can actually teach.

The other huge problem of workload, which I'm sure many of you have experienced: No one majoring in PPE wants to spend more time on their Calc 115/116 homework than their PPE classes!!! I wouldn't want to spend more time on PPE than on my math classes. Unfortunately this is the position most non-majors in Calc 115/116 are put into...and it is very draining for obvious reasons.

# What are The Good Parts (TM)? And the Not So Good Parts of The Good Parts

Like I said before, the math department can be extremely extremely effective, vibrant, and fun **especially if you are a pure/honors math major**. There are a few extremely dedicated, talented, and caring professors within these tracks. Namely Stephen DeBacker and Sarah Koch.

There is a great amount of separation between the cohorts--in that honors math majors are mostly set apart. This is because of 2-3 particular classes. The most (in)famous of them being Math 295/296/297 (the last of which can come after 217 if you've gotten an A). These filter into the upper-level honors math courses 395/396 and 493/494, and many honors mathematics students take graduate level courses aimed for graduate students in their first year (the alpha courses).

These intro honors mathematics courses state a minimum of 18 hours of work per week on homework, and should honestly be treated as intensive courses similar to some EECS and RC Language courses and be 6-8 credits. Unfortunately they are only 4 credits. They also have a grade floor of an A- in 295 and a B- in 296. They're taught by Sarah/Stephen, who stress: being nice, a collaborative environment, the ability for anyone to do well if they work really hard, and getting involved in the department through outreach, math club, math circle, super saturdays, math corps and a whole bunch of other things.

Since this isn't relevant for most people (being non-majors) I'll keep it brief. As far as the bad things: certain professors are clearly looking for the top 2-5 students in a cohort and don't consider anyone else worth their time. There is also a fair amount of sexism and racism present within the honors track both from some students + especially a few professors. 

# The Most Important Things the Department Could Do???

There are a few things that I have been thinking about to help fix all of these problems, and have been taking action on. Here are a few

* Offering interesting elective courses for non-majors, such as a Knot Theory for Non-Majors course (on how mathematicians classify/think about knots) or a Topology for Non-Majors course (how do mathematicians think about shapes and play-doh). These courses could introduce people to the cool amazing parts of math. Frankly I think the math department is doing a disservice by not teaching courses like this. Most other majors have great electives that a number of non-majors take. I take a ton of linguistics electives personally!!!
* Offering more Interdisciplinary courses.
* Increasing transparency between the department goings-on and the undergraduates by putting undergraduates in positions within departmental administration (e.g. on committees). This is already happening
* Restructuring the Intro Courses to be less work intensive, both in the non-major and major courses
* Requiring more professors to teach more, as most find a way to get out of consistent teaching
* Requiring more training for GSIs and undergraduate TAs
* Redirecting scholarship funding to underrepresented students, and not just those that are at an A+ in their class. A B+ student working 20-30 hours a week is extremely impressive, and deserves scholarships.
* Punishing professors who have repeatedly made sexist/racist statements

# What can *I* Do?

Yell at the department. A Lot. In kinder language, report your concerns.

A few of the undergraduates who have contacts in the department have started an undergraduate student advisory climate committee, and we really really really want to hear from you and have you come to our meetings. It's important that things like this get fixed, and the only way they do is if we do something about it--because god damn most of the professors will not.

Here's a google form to fill out to report concerns.

201,Dear UofM Reddit,"So about a month ago, I made a post on how I failed my first Math 115 exam tremendously (when I say failed, I mean failed in terms of my standards). I recognized that it was 100% my fault as I did not prepare for it correctly (as the first exam really wasn’t written terribly or too hard), and you all understood that as many of you gave me suggestions to take the practice exams and focus on my weak areas, instead of just studying notes.

Well today, I want to give you all an update. Exam 2 scores came out, and I got an A! Taking all of those previous year exams, I can see why Math 115 and the entire Math department has gotten such a bad rep, but I have to tell you, this years Exam 1 and Exam 2 have been absolutely fair.

So thank you for coming in clutch Reddit community, and thanks to the Math 115 admins for doing a good job on writing a fair test!

P.S. I guess I also got lucky that Exam 2 scores replace the Exam 1 scores… If there are any Math 115 admins reading this, it would be great if you found a way to implement this as a course standard! It could provide tremendous incentive to students as it did for me",385,11,uofm,top

203,Residents Statement to The One,"Please help us share this around!!!


""To whom it may concern,

    
    We, the nearly 600 students who signed leases, are extremely disappointed in The One: Ann Arbor. We have been lied to, misled, manipulated, and treated inhumanely. We entrusted this company with our housing, and were ultimately threatened to accept their lease addendum, or be homeless.

    The majority of us signed our leases many months ago. Upon expressing concerns about the housing development not being done on time, potential tenants were met with enthusiastic ensurement that the development would be done far before move-in on August 24. On multiple occasions, future residents who had signed their leases were reassured time and time again that move-in was set for August 24, 2021. We were assigned move-in times and addresses, and prepared to settle into our new homes. Flights were booked, bags were packed, and cars were loaded. Tenants may have items that are temperature sensitive in these places including, but not limited to: candles, cleaning supplies such as bleach and toilet bowl cleaners, and expensive P.Cs or laptops. Moving vehicles, unless otherwise stated by the company, are not climate controlled. On top of that, these vehicles are rented meaning that these residents may have to rent storage units as The One has neglected to offer such a service. Everything was going smoothly until August 19, 2021, only two business days before our scheduled move-in date. 

    On August 19, 2021, we were notified via email anywhere from 9:15 p.m. to 12 a.m. August 20th EST that our apartments were not ready for move-in. This is an issue for a plethora of reasons. First and foremost, this email was sent outside of normal business hours, prohibiting us from reaching out to the company and inquiring about the delay. Therefore, we were left to wait until the following day to have any and all questions answered. Additionally, there was little to no information sent about our options. We were sent an election addendum where we had to select one of three options: 1) elect for The One to provide us with lodging, and $50 a day; 2) for The One to provide us with $100 a day to secure our own lodging; 3) terminate our lease. We were encouraged time and time again to try to make our own accommodations, or stay with a friend. This is hardly an option for the majority of residents, as we are still in the middle of a global pandemic. Couch surfing for 17 days is not in accordance with local or state public health guidelines. On Friday evening, we were told the old addendum was void and that they would be sending a new one. The major difference here is that, The One said they were prioritizing hotel placements based on when the lease was signed. They gave us only 24 hours to fill it out, and within those 24 hours students had no access to legal counsel such as the services of the Student Legal Services Office at the University of Michigan. Representatives of The One also emphasized multiple times that they did not anticipate being able to secure a hotel room for every resident who was displaced by the delay. Essentially, students had 24 hours to decide if they were going to accept The One’s new addendum, which released them of liability, or be homeless. 

    For those of us who selected Option 1, we are faced with more issues than we began with. We were told that nearly 150 of us were expected to not have a hotel room. Additionally, the date of notification about having a hotel room was delayed more than four times. As we write this statement, we are still unsure what the next 17 days will be, even though most of us are set to arrive in Ann Arbor within the next 24 hours. 

    Students have continually been coerced into signing documents on non-business days and on very short timelines or again, face homelessness. Needless to say, forcing tenants to sign a legal document under duress is highly immoral. When told to sign, residents tried to sign with V.C followed by their legal name and were unable to do so. There was no way to show they were signing under duress. 

    For those of us who were already placed in hotels, problems still ensue. For example, The One refuses to provide residents with a storage unit for their belongings, even though people have been packing for houses, not for hotel rooms. Furthermore, we were told to think about downsizing what we are bringing. However, for many students, such as international students,  transfer students, out-of-state students, or students who are completely independent from family, this is not a feasible option. As a result, many students may end up surrounding themselves with personal items which creates an unsafe environment and violates fire codes. In addition to this, tenants were placed in hotels that are a significant distance from campus i.e Canton and Livonia. Bus routes from Livonia to campus are a 3-hour endeavor. These are not feasible accommodations for a student-based living property. Although there has been mention of shuttles to and from the hotels and campus, details of this have remained unclear and are causing mass confusion. These shuttles also do not run to other places, like grocery stores, which is what we were promised when originally signing our lease. 

    Not only are the proposed accommodations an issue, but the timing overall has created immense mental anguish and stress for students during a notoriously difficult time in every student’s life. In conjunction with worrying about the global pandemic, a return to in-person classes, course registration, and settling into a completely new environment, students now are worried about whether or not they will have a place to stay for the 17 days until their new move-in date. Students who have paid their first installment of rent and no-hassle fee are now worried about homelessness. Classes begin at The University of Michigan on Monday, August 30, 2021. All residents have been postponed to a move-in date at least 9 days later than originally scheduled and at least 3 days after the start of classes. Residents are scrambling to get accommodations from their professors in the event that they have no means to get to campus as a result of The One’s actions. For some, this is not a possibility as their courses have no practical alternative. 

    Conflicting information has been given to students on multiple occasions. This includes how the monetary compensation will be handled. At one point, students were told it would come in the form of a gift card. Later, several students were told it would go into “Community Rewards”. Following that, others were told that the compensation would come through the mail. Students need monetary compensation during their stay at their hotel for food, transportation, and other incurred expenses. This should not be viewed as an arbitrary gift that can just be given at the end of the “extension period” as The One refers to this time in the initial lease.

    All in all, the actions taken by The One are negligent, dishonest, and inhumane. Their lack of communication has imminent consequences, such a homelessness and food insecurity, for students who have already paid their first month’s rent. These actions are inexcusable. An unforeseen delay is one thing; a complete and utter failure to communicate with the residents, or show them the simple respect of giving them what they paid for, is malicious and intentional. After seeking an outside opinion on the current state of the property, a general contractor stated that The One should have known that the August 24th move-in date was not feasible and residents should have been alerted significantly earlier than they were based on photos taken from outside the property, as well as reports from the neighborhood next door to The One. The construction is blatantly visible without even stepping onto the premises, clearly enough to know that delays should have been announced considerably sooner.

    Ann Arbor records show that multiple homes have failed several inspections. These records also show that some homes have never been inspected or given any sort of permit to build. This has caused serious issues and The One has been remorseless. One student is losing hair, another having extreme flair ups with a chronic health condition, and others who suffer from anxiety are experiencing detrimental panic attacks.

    In response to this situation, the tenants are providing The One and Trinitas Ventures with a list of demands which are as follows:
 1) Half-priced rent for the entirety of the lease as this situation had not been handled properly, has caused damages to both mental and physical health, no storage facilities were arranged, and food costs for our hotel stays were not covered. On top of this, amenities aren’t yet built. Many students specifically chose TheOne because of how heavily they advertised the gym, pool, clubhouse, etc. These are also not being completed on time. 
 2) Free parking for all those who will be bringing vehicles to their property as many students will need their cars to go to-and-from campus and the property because the schedule for shuttles is not truly suitable for those who have classes that end at 7 or later. We were originally told the shuttles would run later into the night on weekends but again, this is not late enough for those in community service-based classes, theater majors, FTVM majors, etc.
 3) Refund of the ""no-hassle"" fee as this has definitely been a nuisance. Even though this was originally set to be “wear and tear” coverage, we believe that The One should return this to us due to their overall negligence. 
 4) Replacing SimpleBills as TheOne’s utility management system as it has been shown that SimpleBills overcharges students and has been shown to scam tenants out of their money.

These demands are not difficult to meet. It is in their best interest to fulfill them. 

Respectfully,

244,Rant: The University’s reaction to coronavirus disproportionately hurts working-class students and students with bad home environments,"To start I will say that I recognize there is no template solution for responding to Coronavirus. That said, I think the University’s solution is not made with certain UM populations in mind.

**Loss of Part-Time Work:** Many Michigan students work part-time jobs on campus and rely on this either as supplemental income or for their rent and food payments. The latter group has just been upended of their on-campus jobs and is now looking for other ways to pay rent. Some of this group might also be experiencing lay-offs in the family and is frantically searching for part-time work just in order to pay the bills. This requires extraordinary effort and takes time away from learning material. Speaking personally, my family just lost 80% of our income and I no longer have my part-time job. We might have to move – not ideal for classroom success. And I refuse to believe that I am the only one going through this; in fact, I know for a fact that is not true. And sure, in classes that are graded on a curve, myself and others who have to work on campus are already at a disadvantage, but that’s life. However, during these special times where this disadvantage is exacerbated, I believe the University should give additional leeway. Allowing Pass/Fail for mandatory classes would be a great start because I don’t believe my performance this semester will be representative of my abilities.

**Lack of Access to School Resources:** Some Michigan students do not have the resources available to them at home to succeed for online classes, be it internet, pencils and paper, or computers. These are integral to the very ability to first learn the material, let alone master it to the level where you could take an exam or write a paper on it. Speaking personally, my family is on a very cheap wifi/cell/etc. plan such that video quality and streaming on my computer are terrible. I cannot load Bluejeans for the life of me and am about 50/50 with Reddit. I do not feel like this is an environment I can succeed in when I can only hear every other word of my live lectures. I get that not everyone is having this problem, but I would encourage the University and its professors to be cognizant of those who have to spend twice as long to get the same material.

**Upheaval of Living Situation:** This also doesn’t apply to me because I was able to leave all my stuff in Ann Arbor, but some of my friends who are freshman or international students have confided in me the insanity and suddenness surrounding their change in living situation. Freshman are being kicked out of their dorms with a day’s notice. Some international students had to frantically leave Ann Arbor to get back to family abroad before their home countries closed their borders. One friend in particular found out she only had 16 hours to get back to India before they put into place travel restrictions, and spent that time, naturally, preparing to fly back. This puts an insane amount of stress on students and makes it hard to learn, even with online learning.

**Bad Home Environments:** This doesn’t apply to me personally, but some of my friends literally dreaded going home because of various issues going on at home – abuse, homophobia, etc. Home is not an environment where these students can succeed, and thus, not an environment where they should be graded on curves against peers who might not have these issues.

And I am sure there are many other difficulties that other students are going for the might not be top of mind for me, but are still equally real and equally harmful to students’ ability to learn and complete schoolwork.

The intent of this post is not to shame people who can learn equally well at home because they have the environment to do so; rather, if any professor or GSI is reading this, I hope that you may better understand where so many students are coming from when they say they are struggling to keep up.

If this is out of place or whiny - apologies. I just had to get this off my chest.

Edit: Perhaps I'm not clear on where I see room for improvement. The following would help:

* Option to P/F major/minor classes
* Refund housing costs to those who've moved
* Provide online substitutes to work study jobs
* Negotiate temporary opt-in health insurance (akin to their current GeoBlue travel insurance)
* Notify professors of their policies so they may adapt accordingly",386,33,uofm,top

246,"If a course requires the average student to live in office hours to do well, it is inherently dysfunctional and inept","If your class is unable to effectively communicate the material to the average student in the lecture and discussion or lab times, and relies on frequent office hours attendance to actually build an understanding of this material, there is an inherent problem with the structure of the course.

Office hours are meant to be a place where students who are struggling can go to receive extra support, it should not be a requirement for doing well. If your course is unable to adequately teach the material in the time allotted for teaching, then it is putting an unreasonable burden on students and should probably be reworked so that this is possible.",366,15,uofm,top
247,Tiny rant about inconsiderate professors,"So I'm doing the semester remotely from Portland, Oregon which is basically on fire right now (yay climate change!)  and let me tell you, being surrounded by wildfire smoke for days with the worst air quality in the world at the moment, as you prepare a bug out bag in case you have to evacuate and check the evacuation map every 2 minutes is not a fun time to be taking classes and handing in assignments. So when I emailed a professor to ask for an extension on a participation assignment worth like 3% of my grade and got hit with a 'yOu sHoULd'Ve stARtEd sOoNeR' I really felt the Michigan Difference in a bad way.

I feel like some professors have taken 'asynchronous classes' to basically mean 'give them graded participation activities that'll take an hour per lecture when the lectures themselves are already longer than their official allotted time'. Fuck those professors, especially if they don't care about your mental health in what are, and forgive the cliche here, truly unprecedented times.

251,No One is Doing Anything About Off-Campus Parties,"My housemates and I live behind the satellite house of a frat (which I won't name) that has been having constant parties for at least the past three weeks. These parties typically have 50-60 people who are never wearing masks or social distancing. We have used the two avenues that we know of to report these parties, the UofM provided public health line and the Ann Arbor Police non-emergency number. We've called a total of 4 times, and in each case the police will come to break up the party and there are absolutely no consequences for the tenets of the house or the other students present.

In the most recent incident, we called the Ann Arbor Police non-emergency line, waited 30+ minutes, then called the UofM provided number. They told us that Michigan Ambassadors had just been to the address and reported that there were only 12-15 people there. My house provides a clear view of their backyard, and we knew that there were way more than that present. After an hour, no one had come to break up the party. If no one will do anything to stop these parties, what are students supposed to do? Clearly neither the Ann Arbor Police or the Michigan Ambassadors have the tools to protect the University of Michigan Community or the town of Ann Arbor.

EDIT: The reason I don't want to drop the frat's name is because while obviously I am frustrated with them and hope that they face consequences for their actions, I think there is a larger issue here. If this is how the authorities are responding to parties, ANY frat (or any house in general tbh) could be doing the exact same thing. I am more frustrated with the AAPD and UofM's lack of response, and this post is meant to call attention to that.",371,19,uofm,top

253,"Quarantining at Northwood: ""No microwave to warm food, burnt plastic in the oven, no dishwasher, no dishes, no trash bags or trash can, no washing machine, no tv, and a roach infestation.""","Title comes from a groupme conversation with a friend quarantining at Northwood, one of several people I know staying at Northwood. Not only has the university's efforts at preventing the spread of the virus been utterly incompetent, but they have not prepared Northwood at all for quarantined individuals. Another testimony from u/sovietPoetaetoe:

>From information passed along from students who were sent to quarantine & tested negative: Students are met by DPSS and given 15 minutes to pack their things for a \~2 week stay in quarantine housing. Students in quarantine do not have access to laundry machines. Multiple students who didn't time to pack enough clothes had to cycle through dirty laundry. Students are given cold food(including meats) without accommodation or alternatives. There were also no means to heat up meals in quarantine housing. Some students opted to pay out of pocket for food to avoid this.

The university is housing individuals infected with Covid-19, some of whom may face serious complications from the disease, in starvation dorms, forcing them to live with unwashed clothes amid piles of roach-infested garbage and to rely on services like grubhub for their meals, regardless of their ability to meet such high expenses. Two weeks of ordering on grubhub at an extremely generous \~$10 per meal would put me $220 over my current monthly food budget.

edit: the above paragraph is a bit hyperbolic, but I think it nonetheless accurately represents my outrage, so I will keep it as is.

The conditions are appalling. I'm planning to reach out to both Freep and the Daily regarding this so that the student body, the state and hopefully the nation are aware of how the ""leaders and the best"" treat their sick.

If you guys have stayed at Northwood, know anyone who has, or are an RA that would be interested in commenting, I'd appreciate it if you could share below or dm me. If you write for the daily or know someone who does, hopefully you can pick up the work from here.

I pride myself of being a (really) good student and I can count on one hand the number of assignments I've missed over the last three years but already in the last 24 hours I've missed 2 assignments. I thought zoom university/asynch would be easier for the most part but it is so damn hard. I constantly feel like I'm playing catch up with the previous days work, watching asynch lectures and then trying to be on time for synch ones. Professors want you to post on Canvas, oh and then post on Piazza, and on by the way make sure you replied to another students thread and surprise! make sure to turn in these discussion questions for the asynch lecture :).

 I don't know why this is so hard now; plenty teachers have more hw assignments when we're in person and it's completely doable, but in order for me to keep my head above water I'm triple checking my canvas calendar, google calendar, syllabus, assignment due date order, etc just to make sure I'm getting to everything.

I'm walking around the building and I enter a lounge and boom, 30 people, all maskless, chilling and doing homework. I raise my voice to announce that I can't take everyone's info down by myself so this is just a warning but PLEASE wear your mask. There's one person who doesn't have a mask, so I go to write her up. She gives me false identifying information. I go into the computer lounge, same situation-- many people, all maskless. I go to one of our multicultural lounges, tell people to put on masks. A dude cusses me out and asks ""do we really have to do this?"" 

Like dang, I can tell y'all freshman don't have the same generational trauma that the upperclassmen do about being sent home last year. It's just so disheartening to see people not care so much that they look confused when I tell them to pull their mask up. Haven't we been doing this for a long time? Don't y'all know how to do this? It's not an unreasonable request. 

And to Housing, I'm scared to leave my room because every time I do, I have to fight someone about wearing their mask. Yes, you have to wear it for the 10 second trip from your room to the bathroom because you have to wear it in the bathroom too!!!!! Yes, you have to wear it when you're in a lounge by yourself, the virus lingers in the air!!! Yes, I do work here, but even if I didn't, if someone asks you to put on a mask, you probably should out of just bare minimum consideration for others. 


And I can't quit because I need the food and housing. They keep changing the RA role because they know we can't quit. And it's university employees like custodians who aren't wearing their masks too!!!!

337,"Help!!! I Got an A- in Orgo, My Life is in Shambles!!!","Freshman Honors Pre-Med student here,

To preface, I got a 4.44x2j18z02  GPA in high school, so clearly I have a superior intellect and higher standards relative to my fellow students. Because of my superstar academic performance in high school, I thought I was bound to go to med school at Harvard, become a doctor, and maybe even find the cure to cancer.

Well this semester, tragedy struck, and the potential fallout is unimaginable. As I opened my grade portal last week, I was absolutely horrified to see that I had received an A- in Orgo. How the hell could this have happened? I have literally never gotten below a 4.0 on anything in high school, and college and high school both have 2 syllables in them, so they are basically the same thing, right?

Now I'm worried that I will never get into med school, because I have an A- in Orgo. I can already see the look of disgust on the admissions officer's face, so I am currently writing to all of the med schools that I plan on applying to and explaining what happened this semester. I was also considering leaving the A- masked, so that I can prevent my GPA from dropping by .0000000000000000000000000000001 points. Do you guys think this is the strategy to take? 

/s if it wasn't obvious

On a serious note, I think a lot of the pre-med students that have been posting here recently need to re-evaluate their priorities. I won't pretend to be an expert on med school admissions, but I know for a fact that you don't need a 4.0 to go to med school. According to the Princeton Review,  The **average GPA for medical school** matriculants in 2017–2018 was a 3.64 science, a 3.79 non-science, and a 3.71 overall. I am not a pre-med student myself, but in my personal experience, the difference in amount of work needed to get a GPA of 4.0 vs 3.7-3.8 is pretty significant (and they are all great GPA's. If you don't think a 3.7 or 3.8 is a good GPA, idk what to tell you). The student that is not gunning for a 4.0 will have more time to do extra curriculars and other activities that can really bolster their applications/resume. On the other hand, a 4.0 doesn't say much about an applicant other than the fact that they can study or do well on exams, which is something that most other applicants can do as well. Do you think you could sit in an interview and hold a meaningful, memorable discussion about your perfect GPA for at least 5-10 minutes? 

I encourage you all to rethink your priorities before it is too late. Being stuck in the 4.0 or bust mindset is in itself unhealthy and the time commitment it requires is not worth it when you could be doing other more beneficial things. 

tldr: you don't need a 4.0 to go to med school",334,29,uofm,top

It's like being a classroom where the whole class gets punished, but the class clowns get to decide if they want to be involved in the punishment too. They won't. I agree with the restrictions & guidelines, and I believe that we need them, but I have also lost confidence in the University's ability to adequately or fairly apply them.

349,To any prospective students browsing this sub right now,"I know when I was trying to decide where to commit, especially as an OOS student who had never even set foot in the Midwest, I used online forums and group chats a lot to really try to understand that 'campus feel' of a college that everyone and their mother seemed to say was one of the most important things when choosing where to commit. (I lived really far and didn't have many other ways of getting this feel for UMich).

So, to any potential Wolverines who may be trying to do the same, this may seem obvious but just in case it hasn't occurred to you/hasn't been said (and I think this goes for most colleges, not just UMich): this sub, the facebook groups, and really any other place where UM students are gathering online right now (but especially this sub), are not an accurate representation of what the university is like during a normal semester. The barrage of rants, students with crumbing mental health, outrage against the administration, etc etc that you are seeing right now is not normal, and mostly not precedented. Last year someone set off a fire alarm at 5 am because they microwaved grapes, and we had a good laugh about it. This year I can't imagine anything being taken that lightheartedly. I'm only a sophomore, but I know last year, although everyone still joked about hating life and barely hanging on all the time, most people seemed to be having a good time on the whole. This school is tough, and it is always stressful, there are always times when you want to pull your hair out, and it probably always will be so. But it is usually not anywhere near the complete shit-show that it has now become. Just be careful about what conclusions you draw from community discourse right now,  because by the time you come to college (Fall 2021 too but especially Fall 2022 onwards), expect things to be different, and hopefully less bleak.",312,6,uofm,top

354,Neighbor at Northwood IV called police on my partner,"Yesterday afternoon I heard a knock on my door. My partner was puttering in the kitchen while listening to music on his headphones, so I answered. Before me stood a cop and two security guards. The first thing I noticed was the gun in the holster, and honestly my heart just sank because this didn't look like good news. They asked if my partner was home and when I asked what's this about they reiterated they could only talk to my partner. So my partner, who was like 2 feet away, comes to the door. Then they inform him that a neighbor filed a report that my partner was stalking the neighbor and asked him if it were true. Both my partner and I were absolutely shocked and looked at each other like we were just struck by lightning. Apparently, my partner was outside in the courtyard in front of our apartment like an hour before this, listening to a podcast and enjoying sunshine. He then went to check the mail, but vaguely noticed that someone was checking their mail so he walked back to wait for that person to leave since he didn't have his mask on. Once the person left, he checked the mail, and went on his happy way around the block. 

Apparently this person called the police because a) my partner didn't have a mask on while socially distancing outside b) he thought my partner was stalking him????????

We informed the police that we've been living in our place 3 years, we always practice social distancing and my partner always wears a mask in crowded places where it's impossible to socially distance. And the cop was like, well ok. Then I asked who the neighbor was, and he said he couldn't tell us. 

When I asked my partner if he noticed what the neighbor at the mailbox looked like he couldn't even begin to describe this person because he literally didn't look at him. 

Like wtf. Been living here for three years. I go and do community testing every week even though I'm never on campus. I follow the rules. I'm friendly to my neighbors. I break down my recycling. And BAM! No apologies. Nothing. 

Best part? I get an email from university housing administrator who says she wants to set up a meeting to discuss the incident with my partner regarding the mask mandate on campus. 

I am about to graduate and move but damn what a way to go.

In any given year, new students come in with some uncertainty about how it's gonna go, how they will fit in, will they be successful, and how they can avoid looking like massive NOOB every time they turn around.  


Fall 2020 brings all that same energy, PLUS a extra helping of pandemic anxiety, PLUS a roadmap for campus operations that literally NOT ONE PERSON ON CAMPUS has ever been through before.  Whether you're here in Ann Arbor or staying home and doing this remotely, this is new territory FOR ALL.  


My dudes, I believe in you.  You will figure it out.  


I'm asking you to be kind to yourself about it.  Be kind to each other.  I don't care if you go in the out the door, or forget to unmute, or sign into zoom 15 minutes late, or call your professor by the wrong name on chat so everyone sees it, or forget your mask and have to get a new one from the dean's office, or miss your bus stop, or drop your carryout lunch in front of 100 people on the diag, or sit on a chair that isn't far enough from someone else so you have to pack up all your stuff and move, or go into the women's room when you meant to go in the men's room, or you get tongue tied during your zoom breakout chat, or your internet goes out so you miss a meeting, or you can't find an unlocked door to where you need to be, or try to join a remote club and it goes crappy.  All of that may happen and NONE of matters.  It doesn't mean you aren't worthy, or are stupid, or that you'll never make friends, or that your entire UM experience is going to suck.  We are all going to be potentially stumbling a lot as we figure it out together.  It is fine, you are fine.  You are a part of the UM community for a reason.  


And you have NO IDEA how happy a dropped lunch can make a campus squirrel, if it's outside.  Sometimes at your lowest moment, you are helping someone else.

## Give UM Staff Well-being Breaks

 As University of Michigan-Ann Arbor staff and allies, we are disappointed that the administration chose to exclude us from the February 24th and March 23rd “well-being breaks.” Staff are not immune to the pandemic-related stress being experienced across the UM community, and the decision to direct staff to keep the University running in the absence of faculty and students sends the message that the University does not value our well-being. We call on the UM administration to extend the second well-being day, March 23rd, to include all staff or in its place provide all staff with two days off to use when is most appropriate for them.

I hope this is allowed, but I wanted to offer **6** $50 grocery trips to any students in serious need right now. If you're comfortable, you can send me a list and I can get the items and bring them to you. 

I guess the only way to do this is first come first serve with pms- I'll return to edit this as closed if I reach 6 students.

I kept failing classes to the point I was at least a year behind. I kept trying to get better, but it wasn't working, I kept barely passing or outright failing classes. By the time that I should have been graduating, I was actually on academic probation. I took a semester off of school because I was kicked out, not because I wanted to. I came back and I was pushing 25 years old and racking up a ridiculous amount of debt. I finally learned how to study and passed the remaining classes I needed to get my bachelor's, it was practically a miracle.

These Real Estate and Oil Tycoons Avoided Paying Taxes for Years

[https://www.propublica.org/article/these-real-estate-and-oil-tycoons-used-paper-losses-to-avoid-paying-taxes-for-years](https://www.propublica.org/article/these-real-estate-and-oil-tycoons-used-paper-losses-to-avoid-paying-taxes-for-years)

Here's some quotes from the ProPublica piece:

>Here’s a tale of two Stephen Rosses.  
>  
>Real life Stephen Ross, who founded Related Companies, a global firm best known for developing the Time Warner Center and Hudson Yards in Manhattan, was a massive winner between 2008 and 2017. He became the second-wealthiest real estate titan in America, almost doubling his net worth over those years, according to Forbes Magazine’s annual list, by adding $3 billion to his fortune.   
>  
>Then there's the other Stephen Ross, the big loser. That's the one depicted on his tax returns. Though the developer brought in some $1.5 billion in income from 2008 to 2017, he reported even more -- nearly $2 billion -- in losses.  
>  
>\--------  
>  
> ProPublica’s analysis of more than 15 years of secret tax data for thousands of the wealthiest Americans shows that Ross is one of a special breed.   
>  
>He is among a subset of the ultrarich who take advantage of owning businesses that generate enormous tax deductions that then flow through to their personal tax returns.  
>  
>\--------  
>  
> A spokesperson for Ross declined to accept questions. In a statement, he said, “Stephen Ross has always followed the tax law. His returns — which were illegally obtained and descriptions of which were released by ProPublica — are reflective of and in accordance with federal tax policy. It should terrify every American that their information is not safe with the government and that media will act illegally in disseminating it. We will have no further correspondence with you as we believe this is an illegal act.”   
>  
>\--------  
>  
>Then, with a $10,000 loan from his mother, Ross went into business for himself, selling tax shelters.   
>  
>\--------  
>  
> Despite his growing fortune, Ross often owed no federal income tax. In the 22 years from 1996 to 2017, he paid no federal income taxes 12 times. His largest tax bill came in 2006, when he owed $12.6 million after reporting just over $100 million in income.   
>  
> In the years since, Ross has used a combination of business losses, tax credits and other deductions to sidestep such bills. In 2016, for example, Ross reported $306 million in income, including $219 million in capital gains, $51 million in interest income and $5 million in wages from his role at Related Companies. But he was able to offset that income entirely with losses, including by claiming $271 million in losses through his business activities that year and by tapping his reserve of losses from prior years.   
>  
>\--------  
>  
> He has made a series of multimillion-dollar contributions to his alma mater, the University of Michigan, which have earned him naming rights to its business school and some of its sports facilities. In 2003, a partnership owned by Ross and his business partners donated part of a stake in a southern California property to the school, taking a $33 million tax deduction in exchange. But when the university sold the stake two years later, it got only $1.9 million for it.

I have recently been seeing a lot of posts on here in which people are finding it difficult to make some friends or have a close group in these trying times. I get it, i was in the same spot my freshman year. It was rough, really rough. my roomate had his own ross group that he'd go out with, and I didn't really vibe with anyone in my hall. I'd spend most of my nights alone in my room seeing everyone else having fun.

I am now fortunate enough to be in a good place, and I am incredibly thankful. But seeing others stuck in the grasp of loneliness really saddens me, and having a lost a close friend who thought there was noone there for her in the world, I don't want anyone to feel the same way. So, and I'm being completely serious, if you EVER want to go out, get something to eat, watch a movie or do whatever, dm me on reddit and ill be down. Ill always be down for anything; if you want to meet my friends, Ill introduce yall to them. If you just need someone to talk to at 2am cus you cant sleep, Ill be down. Please don't hesitate whatsoever, im about as friendly as one can get, and Ill promise you that I'll always be there.

I've been able to secure around $7000 in scholarships for this year (hella lit) but based on where this money is coming from (and rules and all that), they have to send the money to the university instead of directly to me. 

As a consequence, my financial aid has been reduced by $7000, so in the end, I still have to pay the exact same amount and all my hard work goes directly toward saving the university some money.

I came out of class to find my car visibly damaged still parked in the street space where I left it. I am afraid this will seriously effect my ability to be on campus and maintain a fairly tight commuting schedule for a demanding semester.

The only real information I have about the actual event came from calling the DPSS number off a card left on my car with a report number. 

Since the class got out at 6:00PM, the DPSS officer on the other end of the phone told me my car was reported hit by a bus while parked and that I have to wait until tomorrow to speak to the officer that filed the report to find out more.

Does anyone know if there is some way I can follow this up with the school? Is there any policy for damage of student property by the University or employees on campus that goes beyond just standard no-fault auto accidents? Many thanks in advance.

UPDATE: Do not have enough coverage for a rental and can not afford to pay for a rental car out of pocket for the duration my car will be gone (estimated a bit over one week, to possibly a few weeks in shop). No means to get to campus yet. I am hoping if I can somehow get a car (borrowing money), I can ask UM parking allow me to make good of the parking pass I paid for to use with my regular vehicle. Fingers crossed that professors accept ""no transport"" for the upcoming exam, labs and classes.

I would love to write you a strong and non-generic letter, and the best way to do that is to talk about something specific about you, maybe a nice conversation we had in office hours.

I definitely take the time to try and match you to a face, but the students who have set their email profile picture have an advantage here - I know them immediately and they tend to get more personalized letters.  There's a similar effect for students requesting research opportunities, I'm more likely to read a request favorably from a student who I can instantly recognize.

We can offer perspective on Michigan, or maybe our thought process (if we had the same/a similar choice to yours) but outside of that, **it's hard to compare a program at one's school to one you've never experienced.**

At the end of the day, the college decision is yours and yours alone. While there may be limiting factors involved (i.e. money, distance from home, etc.), the best college choice for you will be the college that **YOU** feel the happiest at, the college that **YOU** think sets you up the best for a successful career. We can offer our experiences, but ultimately it is **YOUR** opinion that should matter most.  Sit down and think about these things, trust your gut. Definitely make an **informed** decision though! When I was applying to school, members of this sub were always willing to sit down with me and answer any questions I had about the school (now, as a student, I definitely am still open to this, and I imagine I am not alone in that mindset!), but it truly came down to how I felt when I visited, and realized that Michigan was the best place for **ME** to go to be socially and academically in a fantastic environment.

531,Was one of the people barricaded in Library yesterday,"Howdy,

I’m actually a student from another university, and I am here on a business trip. I was studying in the library yesterday when the entire “active shooter” situation occurred. I ended up being one of the people who barricaded themselves in Shapiro’s basement. 

I just wanted to say that the students I was with yesterday displayed great courage in the midst of what was seen as a literal nightmare situation at the time. I feel a great appreciation towards them for that. 

The biggest things I learned from that experience is that communicating with other people is key and you need to try to keep your head focused on the situation. Don’t do anything that will panic yourself or others. 

Also, some humor and small talk does take the edge off the stress when in a safe position to do so. 

Thanks UofM students! Good luck with the rest of the semester. ",266,8,uofm,top

They’re tasked with suddenly switch classes online, dealing with housing, sports, events, all while adhering to the government and recommendations to figure out the sweet spot between safety, educational experience, and accommodations.

Third, it’s extremely annoying to have so many people come in while we are trying to clean/close. Fourth, there was no leftover pizza for me to take home because you cunts bought it all. 

Finally and most importantly, you people are the reason why we are still living in this pandemic situation with shitty online classes, having to wear a mask all the time, not to mention how many people are DYING. How incredibly selfish are you all to say “I don’t care about everyone else, I just want to go out and party and get wasted hahahaha!” In fact, I had the displeasure of overhearing one girl complaining about how she was pissed because she couldn’t go inside to get pizza because she didn’t have a mask on. Jesus Christ. How little self awareness can you have. “Oh no I can’t have a slice of pizza wah wah wah” Grow up and see the bigger picture. Hundreds of thousands of people are dying because of this virus and you are not helping by partying.

I spent at least 20 minutes this morning deciding on an outfit because everything I put on felt too basic or unflattering. I feel ugly compared to everyone else here, and I worry that people won't like me if I don't look presentable enough. Realistically I know that isn't the case, but the thoughts still cross my mind. It's hard to not feel self-conscious here.

Not to mention, I just started here and I'm still trying to establish a routine. I live off-campus so I do a lot of walking, but I've been struggling to eat enough because of time.

""Backpack for spring/summer/fall 2021 class  registration begins on Wednesday, March 24. We want to make you aware of  an adjustment to registration appointment assignments that will support  student equity and our institutional values. 

Starting with the spring/summer/fall 2021 registration  process, registration appointments will be assigned based on credit  earned as a matriculated student at U-M, or at an accredited institution  of higher education and accepted as transfer credit. This applies to  undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in a degree-seeking program  on the Ann Arbor campus. 

College credit earned through tests taken before  matriculation, such as Advanced Placement and International  Baccalaureate exams, and tests such as ACT, SAT, AVL, CLEP, and IMAT,  will not be counted for registration priority purposes. The change  ensures that U-M students who attended high schools with few or no  opportunities to earn test credit will not be at a disadvantage in  appointment assignments. 

Credit earned before matriculation will continue to satisfy course prerequisites and count toward degree completion. """,257,7,uofm,top

A lot of us undergrads feel understandab;y worried of the extremes of the GEO\\s demands, but what we need to understand is this is necessary. What the GEO ultimately will be happy is with the 80 percent of their demands being met, preferrably more I'm sure but the point is:

&#x200B;

With negotiation, you have to aim high because the people with power will ultimately, through negotiations force the GEO to accept less than 100 percent, which is why their 100 percent needs to be higher, so that the 80 percent is ultimately what they are happy with, and what we are happy with.

577,UofM's effects on the Washtenaw area,"I've seen a couple comments about how COVID is going to impact Ann Arbor citizens, but I think it's incredibly important to also recognize how damaging this could potentially be to the entire Washtenaw area. 

For a bit of background, I was raised by the Saline-Manchester border, both two towns within the county. My area and other areas around me **heavily** rely on Ann Arbor for tasks like getting groceries because these small towns don't have the same infrastructure (For reference, Saline has a population of 9500 and Manchester has 2100). Furthermore, many of our town's citizens work in Ann Arbor at customer-facing jobs. 

No matter the plans the University puts in place, our areas have to continue to go to Ann Arbor because it's a large part of our survival. Careless actions from students **will** reach our small towns and affect many of our livelihoods. 

As ridiculous as it sounds, my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friend's safety are now at the will of the student body population (a population bigger than almost all of the towns in Washtenaw).

First, freedom of speech and peaceful protest are fundamental rights and ChE will not take any actions (or tolerate any by ChE faculty or staff) against anyone for exercising these rights. Second, work stoppage is a legal matter, and consequences may be dictated by university or governmental policies beyond the authority of ChE. There is a general consensus among ChE faculty that individual instructors should take no further action beyond these policies based on a GSI's decision to participate in the strike. Faculty are instructed that they may impose no additional penalties of any sort on striking GSIs. Similarly, we wish to assure all graduate students that their status in the ChE graduate program will not be adversely affected by strike participation.

605,"Lonely people, read this!","Hey guys, lately I've been seeing a lot of posts on here about people struggling to find their friend group and feeling at home here. I can relate 100% to this and have been feeling very down lately. I'm a graduating senior and I really haven't enjoyed my time here, and as graduation creeps ever closer, I want to make at least a few good memories before my opportunity is gone for good. It's time for something to change, and I want to be a part of that to make it happen. 


Here's what I propose:

Everyone always gives the usual BS advice of ""go out, find a club you like, talk to random people at the bar, join a meetup group"", etc. I know you mean well and that these things might have worked for you, truly, no hard feelings, but a lot of you struggle to realize just how daunting this is to most of us. This is the equivalent of throwing someone in the deep end of a pool and expecting them to swim. Most people might be able to learn how to swim that way, but others will drown. I, for one, would be much more comfortable going out and taking risks and doing things in a group, but since I have no one to go with, it's a catch 22, and once you get stuck in this pattern, it's hard to get out.

I feel like if there was a dedicated and organized group to go and do these things in, people would be more willing to take that risk to go and try new things and meet new people. Also, since this group's purpose will be to make lonely people more comfortable and feel accepted, people will come in knowing they have something big in common with everyone there. We all have similar life experiences, and will be more comfortable opening up and talking to each other about it, since we know that the other people will be more likely to ""get it"". There will be no need to awkwardly explain how you have no friends, hoping that the other people treat you normally and don't throw you a pity party. There's no shame in it, no ""what if they think I'm weird"" or ""I have nothing in common with these people"" or ""these people have known each other for years, I don't belong here"" because everyone's guaranteed to be in the same boat, there's no guessing factor. 

As for the group's activities, we can do literally anything and everything. Wanna go get wasted at Charley's? Hell yeah, let's do it! Wanna catch up on Game of Thrones before the new season in April? Movie night! Wanna go see that cool new museum that they've been doing construction on for the last 4 years? Let's go! Got a restaurant you want to try? Let's get some grub!

I'm not promising that it won't be awkward at times, or that everything will be perfectly organized, but I am willing to make the effort to make it work. I may not be brave enough to go out and do these things on my own, but I'm willing to take the risk to put it out here for anyone to see and join me. I really believe that if we get a solid group together, we can change our lives for the better and make it easier for us to follow the stereotypical advice that everyone gives us. Who knows, we might even become friends for life! Wouldn't that be cool?

EDIT: I should also mention, if you're interested in being a part of this, make a comment or message me. Everyone's welcome. I mean it, everyone. 

EDIT 2: Holy moly this blew up a lot more than I expected. I'm a little busy right now getting a project done for my major, but I solemnly swear to you all that once I'm finished (around Wednesday or so) I will go through and make sure that I collect everyone that commented their interest or messaged me and make sure we're all in some kind of group chat or something together so we can plan something for this coming weekend. In the meantime, anyone who is just now seeing this post and is interested in joining in, by all means let me know somehow so we can get you added into our little Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club (the name is a work in progress, haha). 

P.S. Thank you all so much for your support, from the looks of it I think this is gonna be a huge success!

FINAL EDIT: Ok, I sent everyone who messaged me or made a comment on this post showing their interest a link to a google form to put your number in so we can make a group chat. If I somehow missed you, please message me, it wasn't intentional. Thanks everyone for the support!

FINAL FINAL EDIT: Ok, so I was a little disorganized with this at first because I've never managed so many people like this, but someone suggested using a discord server, so that is what we are sticking to. I've never used discord before this, but it's very organized and a good fit for this kind of group. If anyone sees this in the future, feel free to join us!

Khan Academy and other online resources act as better teaching vehicles than the university students pay 80k a year to attend.

Legitimately there is more utility in not showing up to lecture and reading the textbook/watching youtube videos on your own than attending class and letting the average GSI read from their notes page with 0 intention of explaining anything beyond the basic definition and proof. Sad, this is what I, along with many others, throw 80k a year at.. as a DS major!

Also as a side note: if you are taking math116.. don't attend lectures... just watch this guy's videos ([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHhuummRZaIVX7bD4t2czg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHhuummRZaIVX7bD4t2czg)). Got an A in the class and showed up to lecture once every 2 weeks for the quizzes. This is what actual engaging and student understanding-based teaching looks like by a qualified teacher. To bad 80k can't get you one of those at a top 25 university :(",267,26,uofm,top
613,this university is a SHITSHOW right now,"there are a few REALLY significant problems going on right now.


1: cheating is rampant in spring/summer courses. as another poster alluded to, average scores are skyrocketing and everybody's just helping one another on exams. luckily my classes just require papers but i'd feel so uncomfortable taking an exam-heavy class right now!! idk

2: how has a twitter account based on playing judge, jury, and executioner on accused sexual assaulters stayed up for so long that it can reach 5k followers?? it can be simultaneously true that victims need to be heard and the court of public opinion is an inappropriate place to air your grievances. if any one of these people didn't do what somebody *anonymously* DM'd they did, that's a major issue?? umich public affairs even responded to a tweet of theirs and the follower base keeps exploding (nearly 5k in under 24 hours) but yeah

3: the university has in no way shape or form addressed either of these! as a longtime lurker, i've seen how savage the cs department gets about the honor code, but we have a full-on cheating scandal in some exam-driven departments and we're just pretending we do not see it???? ok


idk, figured i'd post something to encourage discussion about these things but ya

621,I was also admitted to a psych ward,"There was a post made recently [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/lmcym3/i_got_rejected_from_um_phd_program_and_i_was/) about being admitted to a psych ward posted the day I was discharged from another psych ward. After seeing this post after I left, I have been meaning to post about my  experience  as well but I am still quite shaken about it and only now have the courage to do so. Hopefully talking about it helps.

I am currently an undergrad in UofM and I have been dealing with depression for quick some time now. I have been trying to get my life back on track and I think it was going well. I have recently been talking to a therapist and they recommended me to talk to my primary care physician about taking anti-depressants and that's how this all started. To be clear, I am not suicidal and at the very worst, serverely depressed with an idealization of suicide. I have never hurt myself or others nor plan to.

I made an appointment to my PCP that I have been seeing since I was a child which was not a good idea in hindsight. They specialize in family care and were just unprepared for what I was asking of them. When I had told them about my depression, they had me stay in the room as they called the hospital to get me transferred. I had to get escorted by police because they did not trust me to get there on my own. 

Once I arrived, I had to wait to get admitted for about 2 hours because they were so busy. When I actually did get admitted, I had to give them everything and wait for a psychiatrist to come evaluate me. That took another couple hours. When they finally came, they asked me a couple of questions that lasted about 3 minutes. The questions were things like ""How long have you been depressed?"" ""Do you think about killing yourself?"" ""How would you do it?"" I answered truthfully but I really wish I didn't. I had told them 3 years, yes, and I guess I would go into a closed garage with my car running. After this, they left for another couple of hours. I kept on asking what was happening and when I could go. The nurses said I had to keep waiting for the psychiatrist. After many hours they came back and said I had to stay as I was deemed a risk to myself and others. Unfortunately, my insurance didn't cover this hospital so they were trying to transfer me to somewhere else that would. They had no idea how long this would take so I was just forced to wait. It took 3 days. 3 Days of nothing but just laying in a bed while someone watched me, making sure I don't do anything. I felt myself going insane, just trying to make the time go by. I was given only a word search and an xbox with no games (so useless) on the second day and finally a book and a switch with an actual game on the third day but only hours before I left. At this point, my anxiety was sky high and was shaking at the fear of staying any longer. I felt so relieved getting transfered, just hoping I can go back home later that day.

I was driven to a holding ground of sorts, where they evaluate you before sending you to another hospital. I was really hoping I could convince them I was not a danger and to let me go with what I originally wanted, some medication. I was allowed my stuff back so I was getting in contact with my family  and updating them on what was happening and my plans on leaving. After talking to the staff, I figured out why I was not allowed to leave. The psychiatrist that had seen me for 3 minutes had concluded that I was suicidal with the intent to asphyxia myself. They had concluded that I am unwell and can no longer make medical decisions for myself. I was told if the doctor in the new facility did not agree, I could have them override the decision and let me go. I talked to the doctor, told them my situation, and was confident that I would be let go. After some time, I ask the staff what the decision was. It was for me to get hospitalized again. I pleaded to talk to the doctor again and kept asking all the staff what I could do. It was already around 8pm and they had said I was the last to see the doctor for the day. They said it was a close decision but the doctor ultimately listened to the previous doctors recommendation. I kept asking about other options, about my rights, about  involuntary stay and so on. I was basically told that I have no rights and there was nothing I could do.  I knew for a fact that I had rights but I didn't know what they were. After a while, I was pulled aside by one of the staff and was told to basically stop being difficult and that there was nothing I could do but accept it. At this point, I was so full of anxiety, fear, and rage. I felt like I was just being ignored and that the staff didn't give a single shit about me. They just wanted me to shut up and go with it. I really melt down after this.

This is when I was finally admitted to a psych ward at 2am. I still hadn't given up and kept asking everyone there what my options are. The nurse there straight up told me that there was really nothing I could do, and the best thing I could do was just go with it as well. They said if I act out, they would keep me there. If I don't take the meds that they prescribe, they would keep me there. If I try to take the legal route, they would keep me there. There was nothing but try to act as normal as possible and be discharged in another 5-7 days. I thought I could maybe go through the legal route but after asking about a ITT (intent to terminate treatment) form, I was immediately threatened by a nurse to sign another involuntary admission form which would force me to stay at least 3 more days. I had given up hope and just wished I could just escape to my friends and family. The doctors there were also no help. When meeting with one, he first talked about another patient in front of me in closed doors to another colleague but I guess I could listen. When he finished, he had asked me if I was korean or chinese or what? I answered chinese american and he proceeded to go off on china, assuming I would be fine with it because I was american. He made comments such as ""Chinese health care is one bullet to the head"" and so on. I could do nothing but agree and nod. This doctor was in control of the meds I was being forced to take or else I would be there forever. For the rest of the days, I was just trying to seem as sane as possible while shaking with anxiety, with the most fear I have ever felt in my life, and with nothing but a wall phone to connect me to the outside world. 

When I was finally discharged, I had just sped through everything, saying I was perfectly fine, that I improved and am all better. In reality, I never felt so much anxiety, I have never felt so much fear, and I have never been so fucked up. They had told me to continue with the medication but I realize after that they never asked for my pharmacy nor gave me a prescription. I was discharged feeling far worse than I ever have before and with no meds that I was trying to get in the first place. It has been a week and I still get anxiety attacks that I have never had before, I keep waking up from nightmares about being kept there forever. I was trying to get better but was left with all this, no meds, and a huge distrust of the health industry. I haven't been able to even look at school work since then and I don't know what to do now. I just hope I will get better but I know it won't be any time soon now.",240,4,uofm,top

*But **your** mental and physical health is more important than all of that.*

If you have time, do your best to take a break.

* Go on a walk through the diag with some earbuds in and listen to your favorite song.

* If you’re in your dorm/apartment, try to open a window and get some fresh air circulating.

* Stand up and stretch for a few minutes, or take a lap around the UGLi/Dude to get that blood pumping just a bit.

* Grab a snack and top off your water bottle.

* If you’re so inclined, take a short nap in the grass between lecture recordings.

Trust me, it’ll feel nice to find a change of pace, however brief, and your brain will thank you.

Grades are important, but **you** are even more-so. Live your best life. Have no regrets.

This school is amazing and if you aren’t convinced of this yet (which you probably aren’t), you will soon realize why so many people dream of coming to Michigan.

If you are questioning what to do about next semester, that is also perfectly okay. No one should feel pressured into coming back to campus. Please, let this be the sign that you should do what you are comfortable with. It’s so easy to feel pressured in times like these (into going out, taking off your mask, having friends over etc.) We’re in college and this is the reality of the situation. If you were not happy with last semester and are considering staying home, that is completely understandable. Please do what’s best for your health, both physical and mental. None of this is normal— allow yourself to have an “unconventional” semester if that’s what you want/need. Things will get better, and it won’t be long before we can experience college the way we expected.

This sucks, but we are all smart, capable human beings and we will be okay. Hang in there :)",230,4,uofm,top

695,Just a U of M Mom…,"Hi. My youngest is a freshman at U of Mich. I am a new empty-nester. I happened upon this community, and I’m so glad I did! I just left my student there on Tuesday and made the long trek home. My heart feeling gutted, and my throat closing up ever so slowly, causing me to make those super attractive hiccup/snorting/crying noises. 

While I am a new empty-nester, my student is there experiencing all those vitality important firsts, bonding with their fellow students and getting the lay of the land. 
I browsed through some of the posts on here, and you all solidified to me that Michigan is precisely where my student should be. I’ve never come across so many kind, accepting, and helpful humans in mass before. 
Keep that up!! 

So many of you are homesick and feel alone. I know I’m feeling alone, but at least I’m in familiar territory. You are in a brand new environment adjusting to many new challenges, both good and likely not the best. 

But keep your head held high!! Do you know how extraordinary you are, and how remarkable it is for you to be where you’re at right now?!? I’m proud of you!! 

Don’t be afraid to reach out of your comfort zone and try something new. Make small daily goals like talking to someone new or going to a different dining hall just because you can… 

Have fun!! Enjoy every minute because, as this Mama knows all too well when you blink and you aren’t living in the moment, you open your eyes and the moment is now just a memory. 

Thank you for indulging me. 
Have fun and be kind.

696,Please sign petition to prevent predatory CSE professors from teaching in-person classes!,"[http://chng.it/9zQ76mHG](http://chng.it/9zQ76mHG)

Please sign this petition to prevent Walter Lasecki and Jason Mars from teaching in person classes this fall. The College of Engineering needs to be more transparent about these professors and protect its students from sexual harassment and assault.

Here is a link to the daily's article about how allegations against Lasecki were mishandled:

[https://www.michigandaily.com/news/daily-investigation-finds-divergence-in-u-m-outside-organizations-handling-of-allegations-against-cse-professor/](https://www.michigandaily.com/news/daily-investigation-finds-divergence-in-u-m-outside-organizations-handling-of-allegations-against-cse-professor/)

I was a freshman in Lasecki's lab and he displayed grooming behavior towards me that I was completely naive about (taking me out to dinner, volunteering his time to help me with a project late at night alone with him). Everyone in the lab left after the allegations my first semester of my sophomore year, but to my disappointment I found out the next semester they refilled all the positions with freshman who were unaware of the allegations and why everyone had left. The College of Engineering must be transparent about predatory professors and protect its students, not the professors. Please sign and spread this petition around.",240,18,uofm,top

701,What B1G Football says about Mark Schlissel and Testing,"Mark Schlissel joined the unanimous vote of the Big Ten Council of Chancellors and Presidents to approve a plan to play football this fall. This plan includes DAILY testing for all players, coaches, trainers, and on-field staff. UM has 140 players on its [2020 roster](https://mgoblue.com/sports/football/roster), who will need 1,000 tests per week (not counting coaches/trainers/staff). Before this, it appears UM was giving athletes around [200-300 tests per week across multiple sports.](https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/university-michigan/wolverines/2020/08/14/michigan-wolverines-football-coronavirus-testing-update/5582685002/)

Last week, the University of Michigan [reported](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/dashboard) about 2,000 tests in total, between students and faculty/staff. This is [INCLUDING tests performed with the athletic department:](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/dashboard/about-the-data/)

>UHS reports information on testing that they perform when evaluating symptomatic patients or close-contact exposures and any testing performed in collaboration with Athletics. 

Mark Schlissel has said the university can test up to 3,500 students per week, though he has yet to deliver on this promise. It is unclear what they are waiting for. If we assume those 3,500 weekly tests (which we still have not reached) are NOT coming from student athletes and are instead the general population of students, we will probably have about 5,000 weekly tests total, from which about 25% will be from the football program, which is approximately 0.375% of students. 

NOW. The tests allocated for athletics may different. They are antigen tests. Antigen tests are faster and cheaper than PCR tests, and I'm not sure which UM is/has been using - maybe all our primary testing has been antigen and I'm just not up to speed in which case you can ignore this whole paragraph. Antigen tests are also less accurate than the PCR tests, and more prone to false negatives (negative result when you are in fact infected). [FDA Source](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics). 

HOWEVER. If these tests are good enough for UM Athletics (who frankly are probably far more demanding on their lungs than the rest of us), WHY are they not good enough for students? WHY is the university telling us increased testing cannot be done, while giving 25% of our testing capacity to 0.4% of the student body? The obvious answer is money, but if Schlissel can add 1,000 weekly tests for football, clearly he can find some capacity for the rest of campus.

GEO, MDining, and MHousing have been demanding more testing for weeks. Faculty Senate is preparing a vote of no confidence in Schlissel's reopening plan, and he has refused to budge in increasing testing capacity for students and faculty. He tells us it's logistically difficult, or that students will be less safe if testing is increasing. Meanwhile, he votes to at least triple the amount of testing being done for athletics while telling everyone else on campus demanding more tests that there's nothing he can do. The message is clear: it's all about the money brought in by college football. They get tests, and we don't.

Just thought /r/uofm might wanna know, though I figure many of you already do.

Edit to add:

Don't get me wrong. Any other year, I'm 100% into Michigan Football. Never missed a home game, and never left early in my four years here. But I cannot support the decision to give them an excess of resources that are desperately needed by the rest of the University to continue the academic mission. 

The NCAA loves to emphasize that student athletes are students first and athletes second. It's unfortunate that the University has made clear that ""athlete"" comes before everything else.",231,9,uofm,top

710,Mental Breakdown,"This morning I saw an email that my professor from last semester passed away. The news struck me so hard since she was a life-changing teacher for me. Before transfering to michigan, I never thought about studying pure math, but in the last semester at my previous institution, her teaching and passion made me realize how beautiful this subject can be and I switched to math major at UM.

What distressed me the most is the sudden and unexpected nature of the whole event. Everything happened after she was diagnosed a few weeks ago. I never thought this would have happened cuz she was so young as a scholar and energetic and passionate and all the memories with her were so real and close. In this summer, I even saw her virtually visiting UM math department to give grad students lectures on random matrices. I took both her and her husband's classes and enjoyed both. There are photos of them and their children on their teaching websites. For me, she was a model of academic brilliance and domestic devotion. This fall semester she and her family were at the university of oxford to be a visiting professor. And now I cant imagine how devastated her husband and children were on a foreign land. It is just hard to believe that all of a sudden everything's changed forever.

I have been extremely stressful since I saw the news and tried to look for mental services. Never since the start of covid had I felt so upset and disturbed by the fact that someone I loved and respected might leave me forever unanticipated. Also as an international student I haven't seen my family for a year and expect that I will not be able to see them at least till next summer or even 2022. I live alone in my apartment since my roommate moved out two months ago. I just went through several finals and am still waitlisting for classes for the winter semester. All these factors are pushing me to the brink of a mental breakdown. But the school mental services had stopped with the fall semester ending, so I will appreciate it if anyone could give me some advice on coping with the distress or finding other mental services. Thank you!",225,4,uofm,top
711,Throwback Thursday - Bursley student government buys ¾ lb of pot to give out free joints (March 1978),"While looking yesterday for something else I came across this story of the Bursley Board of Governors (predecessor of today’s Hall Councils). Based on other stories of dorm life I have read, it seems compared to today living in the residence halls during the 1970s and 80s was like living in a zoo. Sadly no accompanying photo, but I think the story alone is pretty entertaining. 

On March 31st, 1978, the night before Hash Bash, the Bursley Board of Governors hosted a party in the 4th floor of Van Hoosen. The party budget was $400 and half of that was spent to buy ¾ of a pound (!!) of pot to roll joints for attendees. You can read the [full Michigan Daily article here](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754498/719). 

One board member said “We just wanted to do something a little different” and that since smoking was restricted to rooms they were under the impression that it wouldn’t be a problem. The board’s treasurer was against the purchase and thought that money would be used for “the usual party fare of beer and food”. A reminder that until 1984 the legal drinking age in the US was 18. It wasn’t until 1985 that the university began to prevent residents from bringing kegs into some residence halls, and even then there was not a consistent policy for some time.  

One student reported that around 10 PM there was a “buffalo stampede” from other Bursley houses for the joints. “It was a pretty good time.” Another board member added that “The whole thing started in September when we were sitting around and it was just like, ‘Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could really do it’”. Board members were very open with their continued support for the idea but kept their lips shut on who did the actual buying. 

[About two weeks later on April 11th the Daily reported](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754498/793) that University Housing had terminated the contracts of the six student board members who voted in favor of the purchase. However it seems like since it was close to the end of the year they were allowed to remain but could not return to university housing in future years. 

I’m continually surprised at the difference in student governance between the residence halls during this era and the apparent relative autonomy with which hall directors acted. [This article from a few days after the Bursley party](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754498/828) highlights the different student councils across all the residence halls. 
Lastly, this gives me a chance to share a favorite picture of mine [from the Michigan Daily archives, ‘Bong contest in Alice Lloyd’.](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/midaily1ic/x-md-und-kag008/MD_KAG008?from=index;lasttype=boolean;lastview=thumbnail;med=1;resnum=1;size=20;sort=relevance;start=1;subview=detail;view=entry;rgn1=ic_all;q1=bong+contest)",219,0,uofm,top

It's not even just him but like, fucking hell, he's the shit cherry on the poop sundae for sure. I've definitely reached the point where if things were just a little different I'd already be on my way to the psych ER, probably surpassed it at this point. But no, if I fuck up again he's gonna fail me, full stop. 

I'm so tired. I'm so, so fucking tired. And what's next? Getting out of college into a ruined economy with a useless degree and complete academic paralysis that makes me want to die when I think about the possibility of grad school? Like what even is the fucking point right now?

I just want to be done. If my family wouldn't literally disown me,  I would have already dropped out. Everyone is telling me I've got this and that it's just a couple more months but like, what's the fucking point of trying if I'm going to be *extremely* lucky to survive this year? 

What good is a degree if I work myself to death? I'm doing 15 credits of class, 40+ hours of work every week, and I'm *very* mentally ill.

I'm sure everyone remembers the fiasoco at the start of the semester when students were told 5 days before move in that none of the houses that were supposed to be complete on the 24th of August were complete. Its understandable that delays could happen but they told us 5 days before the semester, leaving little recourse for students to find alternative housing. Management says that they found out the same day we found out, but there's no way. I'm sure they have a schedule that they knew wasn't being followed but chose not to tell us until the last moment. They
put me in a hotel in Dundee 30 min away and then Dearborn almost an hour away and then finally a hotel in Ann Arbor after weeks. Every week they would delay move in by another week or two so i never truly knew when id move in. While this wont happen to anyone interested in moving in next year, it speaks about the people you will be working with. They almost never answer their phone and the only way to actually contact them is going to their office.


It needs to be said that their bussing system runs 7-7 Monday through Friday. Thursday-Saturday they have late night party shuttles 9-pm-2am and a grocery shuttle on Saturdays. When i signed i was told it'd be running until 1am everyday and they were going to take a resident survey to determine the best hours but that was not true. The shuttles don't run during school breaks as well. When they are running its fine, but the property is so far off campus that its completely unrealistic to ever walk, so keep that in mind if you plan on living here. 


Waking up to construction is the worst. Everyday, except Sunday, at 7am it starts and until 7pm in the evening. Its not just the One that has construction, it's also the property next door building houses, so do not expect this to be a quiet area at all. 


Prices here are also similar to central campus housing. For a three bedroom its over a $1000 a month not including utilities or $75 a month for parking. It's ridiculously expensive and i only signed because i got a big incentive to sign which made it a lot cheaper. Last year they started out offering $100 dollar incentives but it morphed into thousands of dollars when they needed more people to sign. So i wouldn't recommend signing too early if you are interested.


The amenities are okay. The gym is nice but somewhat small and the ""clubhouse"" always has the fire alarm going off. Theres not a volleyball court nor hiking trails that they said would be available but they might not be built yet. 


The trash containers are always filled and trash piles all around the containers. Theres a lot of trash flying all around the property as well. 


The property is so difficult to find on google maps. None of the house addresses can be plugged into a gps and it makes it difficult for deliveries that often go to the wrong address and difficult for people to find your specific house. 


I have also heard of peoples cars being damaged around the property, but theres no cameras to detect who is causing the damage. Im not sure of the specifics around these claims. 


They use a payment system for electricity called simple bills and in my first month of paying i had a $15 service fee. Compared to when i lived at the courtyards i payed only $10- $11 total for electricity each month. 

While its not awful living here, theres definitely much better options worth considering. I definitely highlighted the negative things i would want to be aware of before signing here. The actual house is nice and spacious but thats something you can see on their website.",216,0,uofm,top

731,Some complaints about quarantine housing,"Someone I had been regularly interacting with tested positive on Tuesday and I immediately applied for testing when I heard about it. I got moved into quarantine housing yesterday and told that I had to wait at least five days after exposure before getting tested. Fine, that makes sense. 5 days is a Saturday and they only give tests on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This means I have to wait an extra 2 days in quarantine housing before I can get tested. I would mind less if this wasn't a deadly virus and I'm in a high risk group. I want to get this test ASAP.

Another thing was how disorganized, sometimes seemingly incompetent, they all still are. I talked to one person on the phone and said that since I already live in Northwood - y'know, where they put potential cases next to regular housing - I wouldn't need a ride from DPSS. I said this multiple times and the person on the phone acknowledged it each time.. I just needed them to let me in and give me the key. After standing outside the apartment they were moving me into for about 10 minutes, DPSS calls and says my ride was ready. I told them I didn't need a ride and was already waiting at the door. Another 10 minutes pass and someone from DPSS shows up with no idea what they're supposed to do. When I said I needed to be let in, they stepped aside and talked on their radio, at one point asking for a name, presumably mine. After a minute or two they let me in and said they had to go get my copy of the key. I feel like, especially by now, this should be much more organized. 

I'd also like to mention that when I told the dean of students office that I couldn't afford the $20 per day they were charging for Mdining meals, they initially recommended Grubhub or Uber Eats, as if that would help with my money problem. I ended up having my roommate bring me food. It just seemed like they didn't understand the concept of living on a budget.

The thing that bothers me most, and what made me decide to write this rant, is that they don't have thermometers for the **covid quarantine students**. When I called the Quarantine and Isolation Coordination Center, after starting to worry I might have a fever, and asked if they could deliver a thermometer, they said they didn't have any. They'll provide coffee packets but not thermometers. UHS is closed for the day so I can't ask them either. I tried their after hours system and was told to call DPSS. DPSS told me they just offer transportation and keys, not medical supplies. I was very frustrated at this point and said ""well I guess I better hope I don't have a fever"" and DPSS had hung up during that sentence. 

It's better than it was a month ago, but that's an insanely low bar. I just don't understand how they don't provide access to thermometers, especially considering that many buildings even use one for a temperature check when you enter. Did they never stop and think that it might be helpful to provide the most basic thing for checking for a fever, a major covid symptom, to the students that likely have covid?

So my options are to just wait until UHS *might* help me tomorrow, or if I start throwing up then I'll need an ambulance or something. They made sure to remind me on the automated answering system that the costs would be on me. This is all made worse by the fact that I have type 1 diabetes. When I get a fever it's bad. Covid is already deadly to a lot of otherwise healthy people. I was talking to a friend and they said it sounded like umich doesn't care if I live or die, and honestly I think I agree with them.

Edit: I just tried calling UHS again. Their automated system told me that they're getting too many calls and that I should try again later. It really fits into the rest of this. The message I'm getting from everything related to umich is ""go fuck yourself."" The only positive thing was that someone unaffiliated with umich is offering their own time and money to help quarantined students. I'm extremely grateful for that, but it's so fucked up that they feel the need to step in after umich has repeatedly failed us. I really liked umich last year, but now I don't think I can unironically say ""go blue"" anymore. Especially considering everything else that's going on besides quarantine housing.

Edit 2: My test came back negative. Seven days after exposure. I started getting ready to leave and told them I planned on checking out using the daily email form thing. As I was finishing up, I got a call saying I couldn't check out for another seven days. I had to stay there two weeks. The roommate of the person who tested positive, who I interact with much more, tested negative 3 times. My roommate didn't get tested but feels fine, just like us who tested negative.  Luckily an opportunity opened up for me to switch to an off campus spot, but if it wasn't for that then I'd have to stay in quarantine housing for over double the time I was originally led to believe.",218,4,uofm,top

742,Proud Union Member,"Not so proud of my union.

To begin, yes, the University's response to the strike (and COVID) has been enraging, tone deaf, etc. No denying that at all.

In addition, I would never cross a picket line, and I am fully committed to the work stoppage as long as  that's what a vote supports.

But this strike is ridiculous.

I've read the demands many times. I've discussed them with union leadership who called me, twice, to try to convince me to vote in support of the strike. Some of the demands make total sense. Others do not, and the representatives I spoke to basically acknowledged as much.

Give every grad student who asks for it $2,500? That's a potential cost of $41 million, and while many students may truly need the extra help, many also do not (and whether or not it's the university's responsibility to give everyone money is another question).

Break off all ties with the Ann Arbor Police Department? Even if you believe that the AAPD is racist and corrupt from top to bottom, most students are in their territory at least part of their day - increasingly so now that campus is largely shut down. Breaking off all engagement with them is going to make things worse, not better.

Cut DPSS by 50%...how exactly? What does a blanket budget cut accomplish? What exact services do we want diminished or eliminated, and what does spending these things on ""community justice"" look like, exactly?

And if this is about solidarity with marginalized communities and the victims of racism, why is that language completely absent from our list of demands? Why does it get a brief mention in the press release but nothing else? Are we afraid students wouldn't actually support anti-racism initiatives on their own, or are we co-opting anti-racist support to push forward a financial agenda? If everyone gets a little money and we all go back to work, haven't we just put a price tag on our anti-racist ideals?

This was hastily planned, appears to have been approved without the clear support of a majority of \~\~members\~\~ covered employees (thanks u/routbof75), and makes several vague and unrealistic demands we have no hope of achieving.",312,98,uofm,top

745,Don't force yourself into premed (rant),"Bit of a rant ahead, apologies for that.

I want to preface this by emphasizing that I am not a pre-med student. I am a biochemistry student with absolutely no interest in med school, but because I spend a lot of time in biology-adjacent classes I interact a lot with the pre-med sphere, and I often see a lot of weird decision-making regarding major/course selection and wanted to mount my internet soapbox to offer some unsolicited advice for incoming freshman with aspirations at medical school:

First, the beast: the majority of students who declare themselves to be ""pre-med"" students at some point during their undergraduate career do not go to med school. It's probably impossible to know the actual statistics, especially since there is no formalized process for announcing oneself as ""pre-med,"" but I would be very surprised if more than 25% of pre-meds go to med school. A lot of students burn out or change direction. A lot of students don't manage to score well on the MCAT to even be qualified to apply. And even then, only a little over 50% of UMich graduate applicants are actually accepted into med school (which is still 10% above the nat'l avg). I don't want to discourage you; you shouldn't give up on honest MD aspirations before you begin your undergraduate career. What I want to emphasize is that concluding your pre-med journey as something other than a med student is the norm here; if you have a choice between burning out or changing direction, please change direction.

There are a lot of students who are too inflexible, too deadset on med school in such a way that it results in bad decision-making. The first and most obvious is that a lot of students force themselves into a biology major when they really do not like biology. If you fundamentally dislike your major subject, you should not be pursuing that major. A lot of biology is about committing more information to memory than should be humanly possible; this style of education is not for everyone. If the subject you are attempting to study is not interesting to you, you will not do well, especially in such a competitive field. And as a side note, if you are very good at memorizing a lot of information, please do not use that approach in chemistry courses. There's a certain pride associated with memorization; it's a testament to the Herculean effort you've put in, but I see too many people make the Chem 210/215 sequence harder than it needs to be because their approach is wrong. Chemistry problems are fundamentally just logic puzzles, and the number of students who think they can memorize every Sudoku board in existence is baffling. 

Do not limit your opportunities because of med school requirements. I once had someone tell me verbatim, ""Chem is interesting but I can't take because it'd lower my gpa."" Excuse me, what the fuk? This mindset is such a bizarre contortion of the point of college that I assumed they must be playing 9-dimensional chess. Are you dishing out 25k a year or accumulating a shitload of debt so you can a get a number between 3.5 and 4 instead of getting, like, an education? In the subjects you're legitimately interested in? Learning things that are immediately relevant to your potential future careers? 

My point is this: for all the incoming students declaring themselves to be pre-med, please keep an open mind. Please take a second to honestly evaluate the intensity of your passion for the medical industry, and if being a medical doctor is really right for you. There are so many other pathways through which to make your contribution to medicine; pharmaceutical R&D, med. tool development, infectious disease research just to name a few - you don't need to be a medical doctor. Take a variety of classes in your first semester to explore your options, instead of deciding on your endgame before the opening moves are played; it's old advice and frustrating to hear, but it's said so often because it's good advice. Don't look for the classes that will give you easy As and teach you nothing; you are here to learn things. And if you realize that the pre-med track is not for you, I implore you to switch tracks. As someone taking Biochemistry because they are legitimately fascinated by the field, it hurts my heart when I see people hating chemistry and being miserable in classes because they can't break away from their concerns over their gpa. These things should be exciting, instead of a source of pain, and when I see people actively root against their friends and fellow students I don't really know what to think of where we landed.",220,6,uofm,top

761,The RA compensation policy adversely affects low-income students. How can we change this?,"Dear fellow Wolverines, 

The University of Michigan tries to be diverse in many ways. The University has policies and programs available to students of different races, genders, sexual orientations, and ethnicities to try provide extra support to these groups while also promoting diversity on campus. 

One aspect in which the University fails to promote diversity is with low-income students. Yes, the University provides outstanding financial aid to in-state low-income students, but I fear that much of that support ends at the financial aid office. 

At this time, the student population does not have much diversity in terms of economic status. We have a disproportionally large number of high-income students, with a disproportionally low number of low-income students. The policies and actions on campus by administrators do not acknowledge this gap or try to provide more assistance to close this gap. 

A policy that clearly adversely affects low-income students is the policy in which Resident Advisors (RA) are compensated. RAs, according to the [Housing website](https://jobs.housing.umich.edu/job-descriptions/undergraduate-traditional-resident-advisor-traditional-ra/), work 20 hours per week during the school year, and work more than 20 hours during training, move-in, and move-out. As compensation, the University provides RAs room and board, worth (according to the Office of Financial Aid) $12,034. 

On paper, this opportunity seems great. When you do the math, RAs are paid a good wage hourly. But, the RAs never see the money they recieve, and its instead directed to ""rent"" for their room. This is not the issue with compensation for RAs, the issue lies with how the compensation is distributed to students.

When a student is hired as an RA, they will see a charge on their student account for the price of housing. This is charged just like any other student living in the dorms: through wolverine access, just like tuition. The RA then receives a scholarship from housing worth the same amount as the room and board cost. This is their pay, their compensation, for working the year as a Resident Advisor. 

If the transaction ended here, all would be fine. The issue is that the Office of Financial Aid notices this housing scholarship, factors it into the student's financial aid package, and then **lowers any other grants the student receieves from the University of Michigan.** In effect, the student is actually losing money that they would have if they were not an RA just because they became an RA.

Now, how does this impact low-income students, you might ask? Well, first let's look at a student who does not recieve any University of Michigan grants. They receive that housing scholarship in full, and nothing else changes on their financial aid package. They are paid in advance for their service in full. A low-income student, on the other hand, is paid as well, but then loses money from other University scholarships. This policy effectively discriminates against low-income students and pays them less for the work done as an RA. 

When working a job, you should not expect that job to hurt your financial aid. As a low-income student, your wage from the dining hall will not be factored into financial aid and decrease your scholarships from the University. So why is this the case for housing?

This policy discourages low-income students from becoming an RA. The language on the Housing website even acknowledges this disparity: ""Please consult with the Office of Financial Aid to determine how the job compensation may impact your award package"". At information sessions last year, speakers encouraged students to talk to Financial Aid before applying because housing would not have to waste their time on revewing your application should you realize that the compensation is not just. 

Personally, I recieve a refund from the University that I use for off-campus housing. While it does not cover all of my expenses, I would only have to work 25 hours per month to cover the rest. If I were to become an RA, working 20 hours a week, I will have to pay $750 per semester to cover the loss in scholarships. How would becoming an RA actually make me pay more to the University out of pocket?

High-income students do not have to worry about the loss in scholarships because of the RA grant. Low-income students do. This, like I said, creates an incentive for low-income students to not become RAs. This creates a problem in the dorms as there are limited amounts of low-income RAs who are able to connect with residents who are in a similar position as the low-income RAs might've faced. 

I hope this makes sense. If there are any questions at this point, please let me know. 

Now, how do we fix this discriminatory policy? 

After speaking with students from two other Universities, I think I have come up with a couple of solutions:  
1) Give RAs room and board without charging their student account or applying for a scholarship on their student account. This will completely solve the issue of Financial Aid redistribution students' packages because of the Housing RA Compensation. Why do we have to go through financial aid and billing to give the student their housing? If you charge the student the same amount you compensate, then no money was really even transacted. Why could housing not just give the student the dorm room without charging them and compensating them for it? 

2) Another solution we have would be to prevent the Office of Financial Aid from redistributing a students' financial aid package because of the Housing RA Compensation. After all, why should students be punished because they found a job and are working? 

3) Finally, the last solution would be to allow the University to still charge RAs for housing through billing, but compensate RAs with the same amount outside of the scholarship. Compensating them with cash, for example, would allow the RA to pay for housing using the cash at hand instead of a scholarship that will adversely affect their financial aid. 

Now that I've laid out the problems and potential solutions, what do you think? Does the Housing policy hurt low-income students? Do you agree with the solutions? And, most importantly, **how can we get the University to change this policy?**

Who can we speak to in order to get this fixed? Will it ever be changed? 

Let me know if there are any questions I can answer for you.",230,17,uofm,top

812,Throwback Thursday - How did U-M respond to the 1918 flu pandemic?,"I'm doing something a bit different for today’s post instead of the usual picture, I hope folks find this as interesting as I did. No class today so you should have time to read it, right? 

I would like to preface this by saying that I am not trying to make light of yesterday's events and what is happening right now. I hope everyone is taking this situation very seriously and making sure to take care of yourself and others. This is an unprecedented sequence of events in my lifetime and I was interested in getting some historical context for how our campus has been impacted by such events in the past.

----------------------------
At the start of this week as I saw peer institutions going online it seemed inevitable that U-M would follow once the state of Michigan had confirmed COVID-19 cases. I wondered about other times that U-M has cancelled class for reasons besides weather (prior to today the last time was on September 11, 2001) and specifically wanting an answer to the question, **“Did U-M cancel classes during the 1918 flu pandemic?”.**

This led me to several hours of reading through old copies of The Michigan Daily from October and November 1918. If you weren’t aware there is a [searchable archive of The Michigan Daily from 1890-present](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily), it is an incredible resource for learning about campus history and the student experience. 

Late 1918 was a chaotic time on campus. Amidst the panic surrounding the spread of the flu, which killed an estimated half a million in the U.S., it was the last days of World War I. U-M was hosting and teaching a detachment of 200 U.S. Army soldiers as part of the [Student Army Training Corps (SATC)](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-87323?view=text), rationing was in place for a number of goods, and students not preparing for service were helping the war effort in a variety of other ways. 

Ann Arbor had relatively few (115 reported) deaths due to the flu but life was significantly impacted for several weeks. [From October 16th through November 7th](https://medicineatmichigan.org/sites/default/files/archives/history_1.pdf) the city of Ann Arbor prohibited meetings in public spaces. Primary and secondary schools in the city were closed. 

Living in very close quarters, the flu unsurprisingly spread among SATC soldiers. The SATC was placed under quarantine in their barracks for several weeks to prevent any further spread of the flu within their ranks, however the virus had already spread extensively. Newberry Hall and the since torn-down [Barbour Gymnasium were temporarily turned into infirmaries](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755693/91) to house the sick. In total 57 members of the SATC died as a result of the flu or complications from it (often pneumonia). 

[On October 17th 1918](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755693/77) U-M President Harry Hutchins ordered that all university students and faculty wear face masks, which were distributed by the university, until further notice. A letter from the editor that day also made a plea to students to take things seriously. Science still had a long way to go back then in terms of understanding the spread of disease. We now know that for those that are healthy wearing a mask would not have an impact on preventing the spread of disease. 

**Despite reports each day of new deaths and infections U-M, stubborn as ever, did not cancel classes.** The [October 24th edition of the Daily](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755693/103) quotes Dr. W. E. Forsythe, Director of UHS, 
> “The faculty has supported the measure well by wearing their masks and by keeping the classrooms supplied with fresh air. It would be perfectly absurd to close school. The students would seize the opportunity to go to their homes, thus spreading the disease...if schools were closed and the students were forced to remain in Ann Arbor they would spend their time in each other’s rooms in small crowds or wander the streets, which is worse than staying in well ventilated classrooms”.

So no, U-M did not cancel classes for one of the deadliest pandemics in history. But that did not stop students from skipping out. On October 24th [there was a report](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755693/106) noting a spike in student absences, especially in the College of Engineering. The following week on November 1st [students were reminded that all absences had to be excused](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755693/133) and that their grades might suffer otherwise. But overall I was quite surprised at how little push back I read about from students. In campus life one of the bigger disruptions was the cancellation of the college football season after just five games. Michigan finished the season 5-0 and would later be declared National Champions.

As early November continued the number of new cases and deaths in Ann Arbor continued to drop. News focused more and more on the advance of allied forces and some wartime restrictions were starting to be relaxed. On [November 2nd a headline declared “Ann Arbor Druggists Now Permitted To Sell Dope”](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755693/137). Doctors and pharmacists were once again allowed to write “prescriptions for morphine, codeine, and heroin.”

This one kind of blew me away: On [November 5th students were asked to return (!!) their used masks](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755693/145) back to the university hospital. Gauze was in short supply and the university nurses and doctors needed to have them for future use. That day there was also an article lamenting that women were being allowed to enter the Michigan Union. I’ve read it several times and am genuinely not sure if it is satire or not. It reads like it is, but 1918 was also a very different time…

The following week life began to calm, bit by bit. On November 11th Germany signed the armistice agreement that ended World War I and a [reported 8,000 people flocked to the streets for a parade.](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755693/199)

815,"Please don't just, blindly push CS when someone is struggling with it.","Hi it's me again,here to try and use my experiences to give some perspective in this subreddit.

&#x200B;

I came here feeling like CS was the only way I could build a stable life for myself. So even though in reality I didn't like it and was in it for the stability, I kept pushing through for the ""challenge""

I ended up failing EECS 280 flat out last semester, and spent the summer trying to keep building myself to be a CS student. I hated it I was just ""Working hard"" but I wasn't happy. And it took me literal years to finally admit that. All of that time wasted makes me sad thinking back on it, all of that time being dishonest with myself because I thought that was what was best for me.

&#x200B;

I just saw a thread where someone was talking about considering leaving CS due to struggling and it seems most people, though well intentioned, stopped reading there and gave a bunch of encouragement for them to keep trying with CS, even though if you kept reading, you would see them talking about how they realized they did not want a career where they sat in front of a PC all day which, Yes, Programming, COVID or not, requires you to do. And not wanting that, knowing that;s not something you want is an im portant thing to acknowledge and accept. Maybe their mind will change later, but it's important to n ot just ""bury"" these feelings in the spirit of not giving up. People in the CS field don't stop being compettive, and if people decide they don't want to be part of that, it's not your business to try and push them to stay. 

&#x200B;

We need to be a community that really listens and does our best to, if we want to / can, provide advice according to someone's unique situation and not just some well intentioned but potentially dangerous broad advice to not give up. College is about discovering what type of work, work environment, culture you want to be a part of. It's not just some painful thing you have to get over.

819,Parents are anti-vaxx and need help.,"Hey, not sure if this is the best place to post, but I don't really have anyone to talk to about this. 

My parents have been anti-vaxx since the vaccine came out. I don't agree with them and I see no issue with getting the vaccine but up until this point I haven't gotten the vaccine because they've threatened to not pay for my college tuition if I got it. With the recent news of the vaccine being required to attend University of Michigan I approached them with the news and they said that the only way they would allow to me to go to school is if they faked a vaccine card which is something that I REALLY don't want to do. I'm not really sure what my options are here and I obviously can't afford to pay tuition without taking out a student loan. Furthermore, when I approached them earlier today saying I wasn't going to fake a vaccine card they essentially said that if I got the vaccine, they would disown me.

Does anyone have any advice for what I can do in this situation? Is anyone else in a similar situation? If I am forced to pay my own tuition, would I be able to get federal student aid even though I don't normally qualify for it when my parents have paid the tuition in the past? I you have any advice on any of this, please let me know, I'm really not sure what to do.

Edit: Thanks to everyone for the advice and information in the comments. I've decided that I will get the vaccine without my parents knowledge as soon as I get to Ann Arbor and either tell them the fake vaccine card worked, or that I got a religious exemption.

I'm talking about people who just ignore emails for days on end and never reply when a deadline is approaching. For reference, I'm in a class where we have a group assignment due Tuesday. I sent an email on Friday asking when we should start the project. Only one person answered, and then when I replied asking what their availabilities are so we can meet over zoom, they never replied. It's been 3 days. I sent another email about ideas I have for the project and still nobody replied.

Now is it that hard to type a one sentence answer and click the send button? I'd like to think not.

836,Rant: The Lack of Transparency is Insane,"Come on. People just want to figure out what actually is going on with the covid case and isolation housing situation, and all we see is delayed and incomplete data with hardly any justification from the administration.

Right before the semester starts, they updated the dashboard so the data is only reported once a week. Like what the fuck do what is the point of withholding latest data from the public? It ""allows the university to post more complete data with less fluctuation and more accuracy""? Just tabulate and update the data daily I can't figure out how that is impossible. A top research public school, with strong public health, biostatistics, statistics, data science program and medical school could not even figure out a way to report data daily in a consistent manner? What a joke.

Just look at peer schools and see what they are doing: reporting accurate and up-to-date data so that people can make informed decisions. Here are links to the COVID dashboards in other schools if you would like to check them out.

UCSD: [https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/dashboard/index.html](https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/dashboard/index.html) (updated **daily**, with documented exposure history and **Wastewater Monitoring** data from all the buildings on campus)

Cornell: [https://covid.cornell.edu/testing/dashboard/](https://covid.cornell.edu/testing/dashboard/) (Their campus had just experienced a surge before winter break. updated **daily**)

And the list goes on. Just google ""school name+ COVID dashboard"" and see how our data reporting compares to other schools.

I thought for sure I'd be here in 2021 due to previous issues with classes but I just applied for graduation today :)

EDIT: Y'all are way way too kind this is so many upvotes and so much encouragement! ❤❤❤❤❤ I hope you and your families are safe and wish good things upon you.

This means so, so much to me. I'm a first-gen college student, hell my parents barely even finished high school. That, coupled with a lot of trauma and difficulty that have rained hellfire down on my life for the past 4 years means that I am absolutely feeling the right to humblebrag, pump my fist in the air, and (not actually) yell in triumph. I previously explained what happened in my years here in response to someone very bravely sharing their story but now I have an excuse to share in its own post.

I have *never* felt like I belonged here, and I don't think I ever will truly feel that way. The only things I have in common with the next person here are my whiteness and age (yes we are a primarily white institution, that's not up for debate). I'm LGBTQ, I'm first-gen, I'm low-income, I'm very mentally-ill, and so on, it's not a contest though. All our struggles and oppressions are valid. Anyway, I started off in the CoE (big mistake, I only did it to make my parents happy) and suffered from the get-go. Yes, I was dealing with mental health issues from my childhood, but there's something seriously wrong with the way things operate if the way they run things pushes people to attempt to end their lives. I commend anyone and everyone with the wherewithal and perseverance to make it through any one of the engineering tracks, they just weren't for me, I guess. 

I am now in LSA and while I can't say things turned around immediately, they eventually did. Not without a lot of work on my end, however; I had to take initiative and have the privilege of good health insurance to get a handle on my brain. To be fair, it's still a work in progress...I think it always will be.

Anyway, congrats to all the people who managed to graduate despite the adversity surrounding them, and I'm thrilled to be joining y'all in December 2020!",199,6,uofm,top

2.) When you say it aloud do you say it like “eeks?”

3.) How could an auto grader possibly work? Like how does it know if you did the assignment right?

4.) Why is the honor code so much stricter and more stressful sounding than for humanities and social science classes?

I wasnt able to get out of my apartment lease because I signed it before covid hit.

I’d much rather be living at home but I feel obligated to live here because if I didn’t I’d be paying an ungodly amount of money for nothing

I failed my Math 116 exams and am now almost guaranteed to fail the class - even though I actually know what I’m doing in the class and have studied and prepared

I’d rather withdraw from Math 116 instead of taking the NRC but if I do that I drop below the 12 credits needed for full-time and I lose my scholarship plus my parents lose my student insurance benefits so thats not an option

Im literally going to work my ass off this semester and only have 9 credits to show for it

I got into the CoE on a cross-campus transfer and I have no idea what failing Math 116 will do to that (I’m assuming I’ll get my acceptance revoked because that class was a prereq)

I am dreading taking EECS 203 and 280 online next semester... if I fail those I will have wasted an entire year of my life

I would like to try and get an internship but I’m stuck on these prereq online classes and I think I’ll have to take classes over the summer instead of trying to get one

931,PSA: Be wary of anyone who comes to your door claiming to be for a utility company asking to see your utility bill,"There are many third party alternative suppliers of utility (electricity, gas, etc) who like to prey on college students new to living on their own, especially. 

They go from door to door claiming to be for a major utility company like DTE or consumers Energy even though they technically are not, then going on some confusing explanation about something about bills and lower fees, then asking to see your bill to review it, asking for contact info and signature for confirmation of this meeting. 

Sometimes they will be slightly more transparent in their pitch and tell you they are a supplier who can give you lower rates. The pitches can vary.  

Major utility companies will never come to your door asking to see your bill. Never show them your bill or sign something with them. 

These alternative suppliers aren’t helping you with anything. They are just lying to you so that they can take your pod number on your bill to enroll you into a service that charges you more without outright saying so.

I’m not a uofm student, but this does happen in colleges areas a lot and just wanted to make sure you guys are aware as you all are starting a new semester.

Please also let family, friends, anyone you can reach know. This is absurdly common in Michigan in general.

This isn’t to say all alternative companies are
deceiving, but many are and have online reviews of people with experiences with the scam. Some of these deceitful companies are also properly licensed, but that doesn’t mean what they are doing is okay. 

Some of their door to door sales people are college kids themselves (not all but some). Goes without say but don’t work for them either, and don’t trust the pitch just because it’s another college student giving it.

939,A few tips of wisdom from a (very) recent graduate,"Know the date of Hash Bash and plan to stay inside and off central unless you plan on participating.

Attending class, labs, and office hours isn't necessary to pass or even get a good grade, but it usually helps and won't hurt.

Follow in the footsteps of Passion Pit and Take A Walk every so often, with or without a destination in mind. It can help in not only taking your min off things for a bit but can also help you learn the area and find new parts of Ann Arbor.

It can be easy to reconnect with friends at the start of a new semester. It can be hard to keep those connections stable once the semester gets in swing and work starts piling up. When you say ""Let's do this again sometime"" and mean it, set a time or a reminder to do so soon.

Sometimes you'll have a hell week where everything is due all at once and perhaps nothing seems to go right. Sometimes emailing a professor or TA/GSI can help, and it rarely hurts anything but your pride.

Not all classes are created equal; some can suck the life out of a semester (MATH 217).

Start looking for next year's housing early in the fall. Consider some housing alternatives like co-ops as well. 

Avoid the central diag right after a heavy rain unless you have waterproof boots. They're shit and flood fairly easily.

For overnight parking, the fine for parking in a university lot/parking structure without a permit can sometimes be both cheaper and closer than alternative hourly parking. Plus some of the structure floors sometimes go unchecked. 

A duffle/kit bag can be a good alternative for storing dirty clothes than can easily fit under a bedframe.

Some recommendations:
Comet Coffee in Nickels Arcade is great for both hot and iced coffees.

TLDR; freshmen violating the stay at home order are now liable to have their housing contracts terminated for a first offense.  Off campus students are liable to be suspended for a first time offense.  Student organizations may lose their university recognition for a first time offense.

""Dear Students,

At the beginning of the Fall semester, we provided an [overview of our community’s shared behavior expectations](https://studentlife.umich.edu/article/addendum-statement-student-rights) in the context of COVID-19. We continue to provide ongoing outreach and education related to these expectations and we thank the vast majority of students for their commitment to safety as demonstrated by their compliance with our [*Culture of Care*](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/care/#wolverine-culture-of-care).

As we consider the changing context and the resulting [Stay in Place order](https://president.umich.edu/news-communications/letters-to-the-community/county-stay-in-place-order-and-course-format-changes/), we are putting in place the following escalated institutional behavior response measures to be applied as appropriate to circumstances. Prioritizing our community’s well-being, U-M staff will be increasing safety patrols and intensifying responses to first-time social gathering violations in the residence halls, which may include immediate parent/family notification, housing contract terminations and other [disciplinary measures](https://oscr.umich.edu/sites/oscr.umich.edu/files/2020_statement_addendum_final_approved.pdf).

For off-campus conduct, increased enforcement of group gathering expectations will be implemented this weekend, direct referrals to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution will be expedited and [interim measures](https://oscr.umich.edu/sites/oscr.umich.edu/files/2020_statement_addendum_final_approved.pdf) such as suspension will be considered for individual students hosting high-risk social gatherings during a Stay in Place order. Student organizations hosting high-risk social gatherings will also be held accountable and may lose university recognition for first-time violations.

Any conduct occurring as of October 29, 2020, will be subject to the above response measures.

Most students have been living out the [*Culture of Care*](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/care/#wolverine-culture-of-care) and making good decisions. We expect that from all U-M students. You, as students, impact our community with your choices. Please make wise decisions in the days and weeks ahead.

Sincerely,

959,"All instructors, please be lenient on student accomodations in light of tonight's events","tl;dr [don't be this professor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/m7g3gf/emanoil_theodorescu_please_have_some_common/) (edit: this isn't a UM prof to be clear.) Everything in this post should be obvious, but as a student instructor, I don't want any students impacted by this to feel like they can't / shouldn't reach out to instructors for help.

&#x200B;

It's basically impossible to miss at this point, but Russia and Ukraine are at war. We have students (and faculty) from both Ukraine and Russia, and for many of them the war may be a huge stressor on top of coursework. It may be reasonable to say the same for students from other countries in eastern Europe, although I'm not familiar enough with regional politics to say confidently. I don't know how many students there are from the affected countries, but they are here and we should acknowledge whatever needs may arise.

It would be cruel to force students with this kind of stress to also have to deal with significant course-based stressors. Speaking as a student instructor, **if you're an IA/GSI/professor, please be lenient on accomodations for students affected by the Russo-Ukrainian war.**

I admit I don't know how to make those accomodations -- virtue signalling is easier than actually helping people. It would be blatantly inappropriate to ask for students' nationalities to ""verify"" something. I don't think there's much instructors can *actively* do besides possibly 1. increase accomodations for everyone and/or 2. write a message to students emphasizing leniency on accomodations. (For the latter I'm worried it would come out politically charged and cause controversy of its own accord -- I might be worrying too much there?). However, we can at least *reactively* accomodate students who reach out about this. It's better to give accomodations to someone trying to game accomodations than to refuse accomodations for someone who is genuinely suffering.

&#x200B;

I am Asian-American and I don't have significant knowledge or stake in any of this (other than an anti-war stance, owing to the fact that my own family still has emotional scars from WW2). Please tell me if I've said anything inappropriate, unwise, or untrue -- all opinions my own.",212,31,uofm,top

Seeing a bright maize beanie or hoodie in the middle of winter (a literal bright spot), gave me hope and reminded me why I chose to come here. 
Since COVID, the most common color I’ve seen is “mask blue”. And cause the university has handled this horribly, I’ve seen a lot less spirit wear around. Without tailgates people aren’t wearing maize like they used to. But for the first time in a long time, I saw tons of people wearing maize today and it reminded me of those winter bright spots. Maize represents what this place was like pre-COVID and what it could be like post-COVID. Maize is 100,000 people coming together every Saturday to support a single cause. Maize is the resilience of a student population whose administration failed to protect them. Maize is teachers and GSIs who risked their health for months to educate the next generation. Maize is a light in the darkness of winter. Maize is hope. This may not be over by April and it may not be over by September. But we’ve got our Maize and we’ll make it through

971,"Experience of a First Gen, Lower Class Student","Hi. I'm (21, white, she/they) not quite sure where to start, to be honest. I'm in my third year here, so I'm able to reflect somewhat on my experience here as well as share what it's like currently, pandemic and all.

I come from a town in metro-Detroit where financial stress, domestic abuse, and mental illness was the only reality. 2 classmates killed themselves in high school, and at least 4 of my close friends were hospitalized for trying to do the same. People regularly ran away from home and the class I started with my freshman year dropped by 500 by the time we graduated, due to dropping out, being held back, etc.

And yet about 5 of my graduating class made it here, to UM, so it couldn't have been all bad right? Well of the ones I stayed in contact with, one dropped out freshman year and the other, much like myself, struggles with motivation and grades and what have you.

Anyway. Coming here, to UM, felt somewhat akin to culture shock. Everyday felt like a new realization. I soon learned that people would look at you like you needed a straight jacket when you'd crack jokes about offing yourself or pity you because you didn't really ever get accustomed to eating three meals a day. (Seriously, I mean, I've had people accuse me of eating disorders and the like, but I just didn't grow up eating three meals a day. A cosmic brownie on the way to the bus stop, maybe; poke around at the inedible school lunch; a measly dinner at home - - that was the norm.) People would get so excited to go home and see their friends and families over break while I sat back, scared to greet mine and whatever bullshit they wanted to spew that time (xenophobia, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia? verbal abuse? throwing and breaking shit? forcing me to eat low-budget meals that physically make me sick due to my IBS and GERD?) Hell, it took me over a year, and being abroad a month, to finally realize that the bruises my SO left all over my body were not okay, regardless of the concern my roommates expressed over them for months.

And then it took me another year, to come to terms with how weak that made me feel, that it was okay to not be okay, etc etc etc.

I just feel so isolated from everyone else here at UM, who focus on fitness or being vegan or going to parties or even grades and classes. I can barely manage to get out of bed every day and the few friends / acquaintances I had made got lost along the way, especially with Covid last year and now. I feel like I've entirely wasted my life at UM, not partaking in any extracurriculars or social life due to everything stated here and more, and that I'll never get the chance now. 

By the time I was ready to go to games and parties and try to make friends and do all the ""normal things"" , I couldn't. Sure, there would've always been the divide based on experience, but I feel like I at least know now how to approach other people here and have normal conversations (I would also like to add here that I suffer from social anxiety disorder and likely adhd and/or autism, too, though any diagnosis won't be possible until I can save enough money to see another doctor. The majority of the ones at UM aren't very welcoming or understanding in my experience) 

I also realize that not all of this is directly correlated with being first gen or from a lower class, but a lot of these are comorbid and this is my experience. I guess I'm just looking to vent or commiserate, but any advice or insight is also welcome. Thanks for listening.",204,25,uofm,top

998,STD screenings are once again free from UHS! Email from Dr. Robert Ernst and E. Royster Harper:,"Dear students:
 
We want you to know that your personal health and well-being are our highest priorities.  
 
We’ve heard your concerns about confidentiality and cost associated with testing for sexually transmitted infections and the worry that these concerns may result in barriers for some students seeking important preventive health-care services at UHS. 
 
After careful consideration we are modifying the policy that was put into effect in July to bill students’ health care insurance plans for all diagnostic testing services, including STI testing.  
 
Effective today, UHS will cover, from the student health service fee, the cost of testing for sexually transmitted infections. Under the policy we will continue to bill insurance plans for other necessary testing and services.
 
You have helped us understand just how important it is to maintain confidentiality in this process all the way through how those tests are paid for. We would never want the payment process for these important medical tests to stand in the way of any student accessing important medical services or testing.
 
We want every student to have access to all forms of health care they may need – from flu shots and mental health counseling to eye exams and contraception services or STI testing – at a cost that is reasonable.
 
The good news is that since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, nearly all students who come to study on the Ann Arbor campus have health care insurance. In addition, the on-campus location of UHS makes health care accessible by a short walk or bus ride for most students.
 
Paying for health care is an ongoing issue that our society continues to explore and at UHS we work hard to leverage all available sources of funding – including health care insurance plans – in order to keep the student health service fee as low as possible. There was no increase in that fee this year.
 
It’s also important to know that UHS has long had in place programs to help students pay for their health care and to keep billing confidential. Addressing a student’s health needs has always been our No. 1 priority. Paying for that care takes many forms – including providing care at no cost for students who may not have access to appropriate resources.
 
We want to personally thank the many students who have helped us understand just how important this topic is. We’ve heard you and we are changing our billing process because of the concerns you have raised directly with us, the UHS staff and other campus leaders.

I transferred to UofM this semester, and I knew since the moment I wanted to transfer from my other small liberal arts college that coming here would be a huge adjustment— not only because of the class rigor but also because of UMich’s sheer size. I knew that finding a group of friends would be hard, but I kept reassuring myself that I’m a social person, and usually after almost a year or so I’m able to find my place. I sorta compared this to high school. My freshman year of high school was so lonely and awful, but come sophomore year, I found a solid group of friends in classes as well as a group to hang out with after school. It’s March and while I’ve met a ton of wonderful people, I don’t have many friends to hang out with or go out with. I want to be close friends with the people in my classes but they only see me as someone to be friends with in class. Most people stick with the people in their sorority/fraternity— which I’m not involved in nor ever wanted to be. I became close friends with one person who is younger than me, and I hung out with this person so much that I felt like it prevented me from going out and meeting other people. I look on social media at people and friends who go to other prestigious schools like Cornell, UPenn, and Boston U who seem to be networking and hanging with so many amazing people from all over the world.

Say, for African American students, Hispanic students, or students from low income backgrounds?

I'm on the outreach committee for a sizeable Marketing agency that has an office in Ann Arbor (and Los Angeles, and Warsaw, and Mexico City) and am hoping to partner with such an organization or reach out to the students in some way for outreach: like speaking about working in the industry in classes or AMA-style meetings with the end goal of recruiting some students for internships. We're specifically looking reach, educate, and recruit students that may not have the income, background, or connections to learn about high level business marketing or access valuable internships.

Again, there’s no important decisions being made off of these answers so I don’t need to talk to an advisor. If you have time, here are my questions:

1.) What does EECS even stand for?

2.) When you say it aloud do you say it like “eeks?”

3.) How could an auto grader possibly work? Like how does it know if you did the assignment right?

4.) Why is the honor code so much stricter and more stressful sounding than for humanities and social science classes?

5.) How is everyone’s code supposed to be different when you all have to do a project like the Euchre thing everyone’s always talking about?

6.) What would a free-response question even look like? Is it like writing code or is it more like explaining a concept?

> There’s no GB marking. The KN95 standard requires that masks made after July 1, 2021, be stamped with GB2626-2019, which provides reassurance that the manufacturer constructed the mask according to current Chinese respirator standards, Miller said. A mask with a GB number ending in 2006 was made according to the previous standard and is still legitimate if the expiration date hasn't passed.^[1](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/12-signs-you-have-a-fake-n95-kn95-or-kf94-mask/)

1077,Pre-CAA Club,"We made a club for those at Wayne who share the goal of becoming a certified anesthesiologist assistant (CAA). The profession is fairly niche, so I figured I’d extend the invite to other Michigan unis. Hope that’s not an issue!

Here’s a link for the 
discord - https://discord.gg/YqwYmPPE

WhatsApp- https://chat.whatsapp.com/H4Xm0cGREBY7JIxfngLWu0

It’s a relatively unknown profession so I’ll  elaborate

1- What is a CAA?

Certified anesthesiologist assistants are anesthesia midlevels who assist anesthesiologists in anesthetizing patients. For those who are familiar with CRNAs, CAAs are also anesthetists who provide anesthesia for patients during surgery. Unlike CRNAs, CAAs must be supervised by anesthesiologists in their work setting. CAAs are to CRNAs what PAs are to NPs. The dynamic is almost identical.

2-What exactly is their scope of practice and responsibilities?

CAAs create and implement anesthesia plans, place arterial lines, intubate, secure airways, push drugs and manage vitals during surgery, and extubate. All of this is done under a ACT model where an anesthesiologist is supervising around 2 to 4 anesthetists, going from OR room to OR room. CAAs can also administer regional anesthesia/nerve blocks under close physician supervision.


3- How does one become a CAA?


To become a CAA, one has to obtain a 28 month long masters degree from one of the 13 accredited CAA schools. To receive entry into CAA school, applicants will have to complete a schools pre req list some time before matriculation, take the GRE or MCAT, show demonstrations in volunteering, PCE, and/or research, and interview well.

4- Why isn’t this profession more well known?


The AA profession came to the anesthesia field a century after nurse anesthetists were incepted. In an attempt to protect their job market interests, the AANA (lobbying organization for CRNAs) have relentlessly rallied and lobbied for the barring of AA practice rights in the majority of states through the use of fallaciously construed arguments aimed at layman politicians who know no better. As of now, CAAs can practice in these locations and states: Kansas, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado,Vermont, Washington DC, Guam, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, and North Carolina.

5-How well is this profession compensated?


CAAs make wages comparable to what CRNAs who work in the ACT earn. New grads can make anywhere from 150k to 200k base W2s for 40 hours of work a week depending on which part of the country they are situated in. The less desirable the locale, the better paid typically. More can be made for those who take call and work OT (multipliers are typically applied to both). Base pay progresses and scales up as one becomes more experienced. Base caps vary depending on the work setting. For more salary info, checkout gasworks.com. Average cost of attendance for this pathway tends to be around 120k 

6- Why does this club need to exist?

The AA profession is a very niche one that has barriers to entry and qualities unique to it. For example, unlike most other health profession interviews, AA schools ask questions and expect inquiries that demonstrate a applicants understanding of the specificities of the profession. For example, basic understanding of the process of how anesthesia is administered , the name and effect of specific anesthetics you’ve seen, and the political landscape of the profession can all be questions brought up throughout one’s interview. The better someone understands these topics the better their interview performance will be. There are other ways that the AA admission process notably differs from other health professional programs, thus warranting differing prep and advice in comparison to the general rules of thumb in other pre health clubs. I’d be happy to elaborate in the comments if anyones more curious. And it’s always great to be surrounded by others who have the same end goal in mind.",17,2,uofm,hot

But I'll have an internship this summer I'll make money from that will allow me to pay any extra I'd need to to have a single (unless it's a crazy amount extra . . .)  and I'd probably have enough to survive during the summer in a co-op while looking for a job if I don't already have one lined up by then.  I already emailed Housing and my SSD contact inquiring about my situation. Was just wondering what other people might know / if there are other things to look into. Thank you",0,0,uofm,hot
1082,How do you rate the Integrative Systems + Design Division,"Hi again,

So I was initially planning to apply to Master of Science in Industrial Engineering for Fall 22 but I missed the deadline date. I noticed however that the IS+D has a later deadline and they offer a program close to my needs which is Master in Manufacturing.

I spoke to the program coordinator and inquired further about the program, but wanted to hear more from the students point of view. My understanding is that this division is very small compared to the other departments (industrial, mechanical, etc.), and many of their instructors are from engineering departments and business school.

1089,School of Social Work Students,"Prepare to enter reality. Those with a C will look down on those who do not. Prepare for UMich health system, in addition to others, to disrespect you because you are a social worker. Prepare to be systematically disenfranchised in preference for other “clinicians” such as nurses ( All due respect to nurses). Prepare for the reality of social work jobs to be rolled into nursing as part of that systemic disenfranchisement. As a social worker within I have been witness to this. Over the years we have lost supervisory positions and more to nurses who despite their education and training assuredly are not representative of Social Work. In turn, nurses need to refer to an ample (not barely adequate) social work department and need not be expected to do more than nursing. By all means, go to the nursing groups on reddit to see how they seem uneducated about the availability of social work for support.  How they are overwhelmed and burnt out dealing with patient psychosocial issues. Prepare for the reality that any clinician believes they can do social work. Prepare for admin to support those beliefs. Has anyone compared the percentage of social workers employed within UMich now in comparison to previous years?  Look at the lack of ethical/morale decision making within the UMich hierarchy. Social workers have spoken of DEI for years.  DEI is high priority at Mich Med NOW but the very profession that has advocated for years and years are not valued despite this. Many social workers are placed in situations where clearly they need a union(as nurses have).  Ask yourself, how on earth did Social Workers manage to ensure they are completely unprotected?  Not one social worker within UMich dare attempt to unionize. That, more than anything shows how weak, useless and afraid we have become. If you speak up, yo are a problem, are “at will” and can easily be fired.  Social workers have been weakened from within, exemplifying the state of affairs in NASW, Schools of Social Work, Michigan and the country. We are “sold an education” and are in debt for years. We are underpaid and are beholden to employers for our pay. There is no dual responsibility. You are solely responsible to your employer. Systems in Michigan are broken and they break down social workers. We now mirror the institutions and are no longer agents of change. Come, take my position as I am preparing to end my social work career.  Step into my job similar to indentured servitude. Speak softly and upset no-one.  My last words of advice: if you want to help and make a change, be a nurse. To all schools of social work: be a department within allied health. Social Work is a concept, not a career.",0,0,uofm,hot

Everything in this post should be obvious, but as a student instructor, I don't want any students impacted by this to feel like they can't / shouldn't reach out to instructors for help.

&#x200B;

It's basically impossible to miss at this point, but Russia and Ukraine are at war. We have students (and faculty) from both Ukraine and Russia, and for many of them the war may be a huge stressor on top of coursework. It may be reasonable to say the same for students from other countries in eastern Europe, although I'm not familiar enough with regional politics to say confidently. I don't know how many students there are from the affected countries, but they are here and we should acknowledge whatever needs may arise.

It would be cruel to force students with this kind of stress to also have to deal with significant course-based stressors. Speaking as a student instructor, **if you're an IA/GSI/professor, please be lenient on accomodations for students affected by the Russo-Ukrainian war.**

I admit I don't know how to make those accomodations -- virtue signalling is easier than actually helping people. It would be blatantly inappropriate to ask for students' nationalities to ""verify"" something. I don't think there's much instructors can *actively* do besides possibly 1. increase accomodations for everyone and/or 2. write a message to students emphasizing leniency on accomodations. (For the latter I'm worried it would come out politically charged and cause controversy of its own accord -- I might be worrying too much there?). However, we can at least *reactively* accomodate students who reach out about this. It's better to give accomodations to someone trying to game accomodations than to refuse accomodations for someone who is genuinely suffering.

&#x200B;

I am Asian-American and I don't have significant knowledge or stake in any of this (other than an anti-war stance, owing to the fact that my own family still has emotional scars from WW2). Please tell me if I've said anything inappropriate, unwise, or untrue -- all opinions my own.",208,31,uofm,hot

My friend applied to UofM and everything went smoothly so far. He got his transcripts in on time, submitted his CommonApp application on time, the whole shabang.

This Sunday (Feb 20), he was notified that he had a missing transcript from a university overseas. Okay no problem, he just submitted his transcript the next day (Monday morning, Feb 21).

Then... Tuesday (Feb 22) afternoon, he was notified that he had an application update. He and I we're excited, but when we opened the letter up... it said his application was cancelled. :(

I did some research and called the umich admission office and they told me that all transcripts were due on the Feb 15. But until Feb 20, the enrollment connect website said ""No additional materials required"" or something like that. So why would the admission office let my friend know that he had something missing until AFTER the DEADLINE? Is this a fair to my friend?

Oh and by the way, he was a visiting student at the overseas university and he only took **one** class that was not transferable to umich anyways.

So what do you all think? Is this unfair to my friend or is umich justifiable?

Edit 1: My friend got reconsidered!",33,6,uofm,hot

1157,A Rant About EECS 203,"I love discrete math more than anyone and if this wasn't such a horribly taught class, it might actually be my favorite from this semester. Btw this is just my personal opinion of the class and isn't meant to hate anyone, just criticism.

Let's talk about the topics. Discrete math is one of the most important courses in CS which is why it is a requirement for all CS majors, and has major applications in algorithms, cryptography and data science. However, none of this was discussed in the class, instead it feels like we are jumping from random topics to other random topics almost like a slideshow speedrun. One week we are doing modular arithmetic, the next week its logical equivalences, and the next we are somehow at sets. It feels like we are just barely learning about one topic, and the next we are at a totally different topic. I never feel like I am learning the material in depth and thoroughly understanding its applications and importance.

Then there are the lectures for the course. The lecturers are all very nice people, but other than Gratez, they seriously can't teach. At one point, I had to skip Gratez's lectures on natural deduction because I procrastinated too much on a 280 project, and couldn't find their lecture recordings (It was probably there somewhere, I'm just too dumb to find it) so I decided to try some of the other professors recordings. They just read information from slides and do problems without really explaining what was going on. Take F-elim for example. The reason why F-elim works is that if you know either A or B is true, and you know that A is false, then it follows that B has to be true otherwise it would contradict the first statement. However, instead of explaining this, they decide to present F-elim along with 16 other different rules with strange symbols and assumption boxes that I couldn't make sense of since I was becoming so overwhelmed from them talking about each rule in a single sentence and jumping to the next rule. The concepts are actually really easy but the logical reasoning behind how/why each rule works was never properly explained. I went to Regan's OH and learned more about natural deduction in 30 minutes than from two 1.5 hour lectures and walked away with natural deduction being my new favorite topic, but this really shouldn't be happening.

The homeworks, while being ok, shouldn't be graded on accuracy. Homework is supposed to be part of the learning process, when you learn from your mistakes etc, yet they are graded like tests. In other classes like math or chem or physics you get multiple tries and hints so that you can learn the concepts but in 203 if you get the initial concepts wrong, you will probably lose a large chunk of your grade for that assignment. It just feels very disheartening for students who have initial struggles with the concepts and are trying very hard to learn the material.

Overall, I think the content of the class itself is very fun and interesting and I recommend even non CS majors to take the class just for the fun content. I really enjoyed the group homework because a lot of the problems feel like mind games which have really neat and clever solutions. I also think it is one of the easier STEM classes at umich, much easier than Math 116 even though that class was taught better. However, there are so many flaws with this class that could be easily fixed (having less topics and instead spending more time on each topic, teach the concepts and not the rules, fixing the homework, letting us know the applications etc) so I'm just going to post my rant here cus I feel like it.",61,13,uofm,hot

- I'm very passionate about music (listening and playing in public), how is the scene around Ann Arbor in your opinion?
- Currently **there's no guaranteed research or funding** attached to the offer. Are there avenues to approach getting this? I'm aware of the GSA role, but how are these typically obtained?
- **I have a standing offer from MSU with full tuition and research for a Master's program.** In your opinion, does this outweigh UofM? Clearly one has better facilities, but funding is a huge incentive.

1203,Exam Time Limits,"I was going to post this on Piazza for my class, but thought it was much better suited for Reddit.

I have a midterm exam on Wednesday that is going to be administered on Gradescope, as many exams have been for the past two years since the pandemic started. The instructors have posted that the exam should take us 80 minutes to complete and that they're giving us an extra 40 minutes for submission time. Well, I just took the practice exam and let's just say there is no chance I was going to finish that thing in 80 minutes and 120 minutes would be cutting it close. I have attended all lectures and done well on homework and quizzes up to this point although I just started formally studying today.

This isn't the first class I've had this issue either where you're given an exam time estimation with a submission buffer. I get that we're given 120 minutes total for the exam, but outside of an absolute horror story, I doubt it should take anyone more than 20 minutes to upload their written portions to Gradescope. What bothers me is why not just say the exam should take 100 minutes and 20 minutes of submission? There's no question exams have gotten more difficult since classes went remote in order to offset cheating, but thinking (or pretending) they should still take us the same amount of time  as they did pre-pandemic is absurd, especially for those who don't use external resources. 

Either a) the course staff genuinely thinks these exams should take the students as long as they say, which is extrememly tone deaf, or b) they are just covering themselves assuming students will work past their ""estimation"" and can say ""well we gave you 40 minutes to submit"" if a student doesn't submit in time even though the exam actually takes longer than what they said to complete. I've noticed this in a lot of my classes and although I've never had an issue submitting on time, its just kind of annoying.

1355,"To those looking at taking EECS 441 with Soloway, here's what you'd be getting into","I'm in this class right now - so, granted, I haven't experienced it through the end. But there's hardly anything else on Reddit about this course/professor so I'd like to relay my experience so far.

**Course Content**

The course title is ""Mobile App Development for Entrepreneurs"". In the first week of classes, Soloway put emphasis on the ""Entrepreneurs"" part of this title and stressed that there will not be any technical or programming lectures - rather, the content would be based around the entrepreneurship component. He goes great lengths to make this clear in the syllabus, where he plucks out excerpts from previous semesters’ student feedback and defends himself against them (not a great first impression).

That all being said, we've had a total of one (or arguably two) actual substantive lectures so far - and there are three classes a week. The approximate breakdown of how class time has been spent so far is as follows:

* 10%: meaningful lectures
* 30%: class-wide discussion of current events in the tech world
* 60%: student presentations

Despite very explicitly being a class about the entrepreneurial side of app development, there has been precisely zero discussion so far as to core concepts/ideas as fundamental as finances or marketing. ""How could our app idea be monetized?"" is a completely nonexistent subject, to the point where project groups are presenting app ideas that are superior to existing competitors because ""ours will be free"", and Soloway just... accepts that reasoning.

Student's grades are almost entirely about delivering \~7 different presentations throughout the semester, and less so about the substance of those presentations or what they actually produce as their final project. For example, making your company analysis presentation exactly eight minutes in length (with a 15-second margin for error provided) is a significant part of your grade. *At best*, this has been a public speaking course with technology as a background theme.

**Unclear Expectations**

In each presentation, Soloway is seeking something very specific. But these expectations are never quite clear and seem to change on a whim.

You're gonna start the class, and Soloway will tell you that your first presentation must be exactly eight slides, with such-and-such content on each slide, and exactly four minutes in length. You're gonna think to yourself, ""I dunno what that Reddit person was going off about, Soloway told us exactly what we need to do"". Then the day of the presentation is gonna roll around, and he'll say at the last minute that *everyone is now required to skip slide 7* because ""slide 7 is all bullshit anyways"" (actual quote). How in the hell were you supposed to prepare for that when practicing to meet the exact four-minute requirement?

The real difficulty of this class comes in simply figuring out what exactly Soloway wants, and providing exactly what he wants. Soloway himself will attest to the difficulty of this: ""I have been known to make EVERYONE redo the second presentation in previous semesters!"", he boasts repeatedly. Anyone who knows anything about anything realizes that failing every single person in a class is a sign of unclear expectations and/or poor teaching, but this thought appears to evade Soloway.

He's right - it's a serious challenge to satisfy him. Any slide anyone presents to him will always have too much text, or too little text, or too many bullets, or too few bullets, or he won't like the picture on it, or you should've said something very slightly different, or this chart has too many words, or this mockup is too complex, or that mockup is too simple, or some other tedious BS. Another great Soloway feature: he criticizes practically every single presentation on these points live in front of the rest of the class, and the presenters are not allowed to respond in any way, ultimately creating an act of humiliation at its finest.

**Unattainable Expectations**

Soloway will freely admit that, although he keeps up to date with the tech world, he lacks any real programming/software engineering skills. That's fine, but a problem arises when he tries to critique projects on their technical merits. He gives you three minutes for you to describe your planned next steps for developing your app on a fairly surface level, then he tries to tell you why this app is either too much or too little work for your group. This has been a consistent theme for almost every group who's ever presented anything thus far; Soloway understands what a database is, but he doesn't appear to understand (for example) that three nearly-identical app screens don't need to be written completely from scratch three times, so in his view your project is too complicated and you'll get a poor grade for your presentation.

The fact that he's grading so heavily on this at all is already a problem, given that he can't possibly know everything about every group's skills, experience, team dynamics, schedules, etc. But he also fails to realize how his own lack of experience harms his judgment in this area, which means many presentations’ grades are effectively a crapshoot.

**Climate Issues**

Already on several occasions this semester, Soloway has been criticized for saying (or allowing others to say) things that are harmful to building a safe an inclusive environment for students of all identities. The most egregious instance of this was when he said loudly in front of one of his sections, ""Oh, women have babies, men have buildings. Right, \[laughing\] I mean, right? We can't, we want to build something. Like a building!"" I don't think I need to explain why this is a horrible and insensitive thing to say, especially given the current climate across CSE as a whole. Soloway later apologized to that section (but not to the other section, all of whom heard about the comment nonetheless).

**The Verdict (so far)**

In almost every way aside from core themes, this course/professor strongly resembles that of a low-quality community college course. As a professor of a CS capstone course lacking technical experience and who is seemingly unwilling to teach about much else, Soloway provides little more value than that of a random community college professor. The overall workload is fairly low, but the work itself is merely a frustrating exercise in decoding the precise desires of a whimsical man. Indeed, the bulk of your time spent doing course work will be spent thinking ""what are Soloway's personal opinions"" and ""how would Soloway react to this"" rather than ""what would the best solution be for this problem"". If you engage in this exercise, you will very likely get a passing grade, but my god is it obnoxious and unproductive.

If you are looking for a capstone course to develop meaningful skills or to learn pretty much anything about anything, I cannot recommend this course. If you just want to pass a capstone course with a relatively low workload, and are cool with handling all the BS above (including the rather alarming climate issues), then this course might be worth looking into.

Again, it might be good to take this review with a grain of salt since we're only a month and a half in to the semester. But the overarching themes above have been consistent trends so far.",126,6,uofm,hot

1357,I am at the edge of dropping CHEM 230 (physical chemistry),"I don’t know what to do 😭 or how to study. It’s only a 3 credit course and I study more for it than my other classes all combined.

The exams are so horrible, I can’t even describe how I feel studying for this course. 

I know it’s not me, like I know I am a good student and I do perfectly fine in other classes. But there’s some type of gap between what we are shown in lectures/quizzes and what we are tested on the exams. Or there’s some gap between the teaching style and my brain because I can’t seem to comprehend things. 

I’ve an exam tomorrow and I’m stressing over it very badly even though I studied as much as I could. I have never stressed over any other classes this much ever before. I don’t wanna give up 🥺 but at the same time I don’t have the brain capacity 😔 to deal with it and have fear of failing all semester long and not do well in other classes.

Do M-Engin students have a significant leg up in terms of internship/research/co-op opportunities compared to students who maintain a high-enough GPA and take advantage of the opportunities at the EAC(engineering advising center) and ECRC(engineering career resource center)?

Do the courses taken during the 5-week program before freshman year provide significant help in getting you accustomed to courses or can non-M-Engin students still become accustomed similarly quickly given regular class attendance and revision outside of the classroom?

I guess I don't want to miss out on opportunities that can support me both academically and career-wise and I want to know if M-Engin is one of those critical experiences that can make a huge difference during my time at CoE. Please share your thoughts on this matter.

1369,Please Consider Supporting Inter-Cooperative Council Members [more info below + comments]," Dear Community Members, Cooperative Partners, and Supportive Citizens,

**Please accept \[another\] shameless plug to donate to the Inter-Cooperative Council to help support members who are struggling financially due to the pandemic.** [This is the link to our Go Fund Me page which describes our goals](https://gofund.me/501f0ea8). Every dollar will go directly towards a member who has demonstrated financial need as a result of the pandemic. Many of our members are low-income, working students and many have been disproportionately affected by covid19, and communal housing poses unique risks during the pandemic. Although the Omicron variant was generally less unpleasant than earlier strains, the highly contagious nature of it means we have had many folks who entered quarantine housing and took time off work as a result.

**Who Are We?**

The Inter-Cooperative Council, Ann Arbor is a 503(c) non-profit that provides affordable housing to primarily students, though we have plenty of non-student members too. Our organization is 76 years old and contains roughly 550 members distributed across 16 houses. We are a voluntary, open-membership organization that runs democratically by the will of the members. We are dedicated to fair & equal housing, housing affordability, and race/class/gender/nationality/climate/sustainability justice. We run our community according to a set of cooperative principles and share in house labor. Group meals and “guff” (meaning: for anyone, a communal good) food is purchased with money that house members pool together. Many properties have fun, miscellaneous amenities such as pool tables, communal TVs/appliances, and entertainment subscriptions. For many members current and former, our community and houses are home. I’m one of those members for sure.

**How has the ICC fared during the Pandemic?**

Thank you for asking, that's very sweet of you <3

Our membership has remained resilient, flexible, and compassionate during the pandemic, as is to be expected from such a fine group of passionate people. We have worked overtime to get our houses full, and in service to that, have implemented many covid19 safety policies to ensure our houses can stay full.

We created a member-run committee, the Covid19 Task Force, which meets regularly to keep abreast of the ever-shifting landscape that is the pandemic and recommend policies and action steps the ICC can take to keep our community safe. We have our Covid19 Scholarship (the whole reason for this post), which can be accessed by any member needing assistance during this time. All of our organizational meetings and trainings take place over zoom to mitigate the spread between houses. We have intermittently implemented large gathering moratoriums to respond to pandemic trends and case spikes. Most recently, we bulk ordered and distributed n95 masks to all of our members to keep them as safe as possible during the omicron wave (thank you so much to U of M's student government for giving us a grant for this!).

1386,Studying abroad as a senior,"I’m a current junior and am considering studying abroad next year. I only need to be on campus one more semester to finish my requirements, and I get good financial aid so I might as well spend a semester abroad. I can’t decide which semester to go though. Any advice/experience from seniors who studied abroad would he appreciated. 

I can either study fall 2022 or winter 2023. If I do fall 2022, I would still have one semester left on campus. Though, I would miss the fall and football season (my favorite time to be in AA). The program I really want to go on also isn’t available in the fall, though there are still some other really great study abroad programs.

If I go in the winter, I would have my fall semester and my preferred program, though I would miss my last semester on campus and possibly miss graduation. I could attend the December graduation instead, but would miss my department graduation that takes place in late April. Any advice? What would you do in such a situation?",15,0,uofm,hot

1394,PHRMACOL 425 How it's structured and what it is like,"*I'm making this post halfway through the semester because I couldn't find any information regarding this course prior to enrolling in it; therefore, I will be putting the information out there. For anyone that finds this post, I was/am enrolled in PHRMACOL 425 during the WINTER 2022 term.*

**The first few weeks:** All of the material for the first exam is structured and relatively easy. The exam itself is open book/open note and students are given the entire day, 6AM-11:59PM, to take the exam on Canvas. There is no homework for the first 2-3 weeks of the course.

**The remainder of the course (so far):** After the first exam, students begin reading research papers, giving presentations, and working for class participation.

* **The presentations:** Students are randomly assigned into groups of 3, then assigned one research paper to present on (so far, the papers have been 7-15 pages). Each group is expected to give a 30 minute presentation, then answer questions regarding their presentation. This occurs three times throughout the semester.
   * **Deficits:**
      * Presentation slides are due on the day that students are giving presentations; therefore, the first groups presenting (group A/B) are given about 4-5 days to prepare- whereas the last groups are given about two weeks to prepare.
      * Papers range from 7-15 pages so some groups have more work to do than others.
      * Groups are randomly assigned each time. If a student is assigned to group A the first time, then they could be assigned to group A the second time. Hypothetically, someone could be given 4-5 days to prepare a 30 minute presentation every time whereas another student might always have 2 weeks to prepare.
   * **Positives:**
      * Grading is very generous, if the paper is read thoroughly and presented in a meaningful way, then it's easy to score 100%.
      * Slides can be wordy. 
      * Students can read directly from the slides (no need to worry about memorizing every word).
* **The participation credit(s):** While some students are presenting, other students are expected to ask questions regarding each paper. Questions can be asked in person or online.
   * **Deficits:**
      * Students posting questions online must read each paper prior to class. Although this is expected of every student enrolled in the course, students asking questions in-person don't technically have to read the papers ahead of time (or at all, technically). 
      * There is no feedback regarding submitted documents/questions; therefore, the grading criteria is unknown- making it difficult to improve on question quality (if that even makes sense). 
   * **Positives:**
      * Students that feel uncomfortable asking questions in class can submit them in a word/pdf document prior to class. For some people, such as myself, this is a far less stressful alternative.
      * Grading is lenient, I haven't gotten less than a 90% for any participation scores.

*I will update this again as the semester progresses. I hope that it doesn't seem too excessive but I love to know exactly what I'm getting myself into when I'm enrolling in each semester and Atlas doesn't offer a whole lot of information.*",36,4,uofm,hot

And at UM, you are automatically in the nursing school once you get accepted. 
Money is a big factor, as my parents can't help me with college, but UM has offered me a $15,000 Grant, which I'm not sure if it's for one year or all four. So at this point, if would be cheaper to go to U of M.

I came out of class to find my car visibly damaged still parked in the street space where I left it. I am afraid this will seriously effect my ability to be on campus and maintain a fairly tight commuting schedule for a demanding semester.

The only real information I have about the actual event came from calling the DPSS number off a card left on my car with a report number. 

Since the class got out at 6:00PM, the DPSS officer on the other end of the phone told me my car was reported hit by a bus while parked and that I have to wait until tomorrow to speak to the officer that filed the report to find out more.

Does anyone know if there is some way I can follow this up with the school? Is there any policy for damage of student property by the University or employees on campus that goes beyond just standard no-fault auto accidents? Many thanks in advance.

UPDATE: Do not have enough coverage for a rental and can not afford to pay for a rental car out of pocket for the duration my car will be gone (estimated a bit over one week, to possibly a few weeks in shop). No means to get to campus yet. I am hoping if I can somehow get a car (borrowing money), I can ask UM parking allow me to make good of the parking pass I paid for to use with my regular vehicle.

I have a photocopy of it, but I’m missing a few words on various pages where there are photocopy blotches obscuring the text. And I have tried requesting scans from the library staff, but they haven't had the time to explain the various listings and have simply made further scans of photocopy reprints with the same photocopy blotches.

Kaczynski is aged 79 now, and has been transferred to a prison hospital, so may die any day. I know it’s morbid rushing to try and get a book out before someone’s death, even if that person is a serial killer, but I started this project before I knew he was sick and I’d really like to get some mention into the news cycle clearly critiquing his philosophy and explaining his psychology, so that less wayward souls get lost down the eco-fundamentalist rabbit hole.

In return for visiting the University Library and taking photographs of the pages with missing text, I can potentially offer a few of or all these options; payment via paypal, a digital copy of his autobiographical book, a free print copy of my biography and your name credited in the book.

So, if you like the idea and have the time, you can email me at [theosladehome@gmail.com](mailto:theosladehome@gmail.com) and I’ll send you a bunch of free stuff and explain what documents to request and how to find the missing text.

1471,"Perusall is Frustrating, Unnecessary, and Hurtful to the Learning Experience","As a second semester senior I have had a lot of experience with Perusall in a variety of classes. I have hit the point where I feel like I need to say something or simply vent. Other students have complained about this as well so I thought I would share my opinion.

If you haven't used Perusall, it's a service that professors use that grades students on annotations on readings. It is usually a recurring assignment that professors have that is paired with the readings for each class/week. You are graded on the quality of your annotations along with the spacing of annotations throughout the reading.

Over the years I have found Perusall assignments to be incredibly frustrating. My frustration stems from the automatic grading system's judgements of my annotations. Sometimes I will leave a comment that I think is very strong and I will not get credit for it, and sometimes I will leave a weaker one and it will give me credit. It is mind-bogglingly inconsistent. There are zero clear criteria that are listed in judging comments, aside from the vague statement that for full credit you have to ""demonstrate thorough and thoughtful reading and insightful interpretation of the reading."" No one knows what this means, and we are left at the mercy of an inaccurate, unreliable program to judge our comments. The program also has no concept of outside material unrelated to that specific reading, so useful comments that connect the current reading to other course materials or real-world examples are almost never given credit. I often find myself having to go back several times through readings that I already fully understand just to find good spaces to leave comments that the mighty Perusall will deem worthy.

The act of having to leave these annotations simply and clearly hurts the learning process. While reading, instead of critically thinking about the meaning and impacts of the subject matter, I find myself far more concerned with the thought of ""How can I turn this into an annotation?"" or ""Is this point spaced out far enough from my last annotation?"" It makes me solely concerned with my grade and the ridiculous spacing requirement, which is not the point of reading. The point of reading is to prepare yourself for assignments/quizzes/exams that affect your grade. Reading is the part of class where you LEARN the material, not get tested on it. Some professors would respond by saying that they use Perusall to make sure that students are keeping up with readings, or that they are trying to award as many points to students as possible. 

To this I say, we are not babies. If you want students to keep up with reading, make your assignments/tests so that doing the reading is rewarded. Have at least a little bit of faith in your students at the #1 public university in America that they will do the reading for a class that they're paying thousands of dollars for. And if some don't, those students will struggle on assessments because they made their choice not to read. If you want to give a lot of points to students like I mentioned above, why not just have simple questions to answer after doing the reading that an actual human who understands the course material can check?

Ah, I know why. Because most profs and GSIs are too lazy to check and grade those assignments.

Maybe this does not apply to some students who just have a better feel for Perusall and know how to game the system and get credit easier. To those people I say, good for you. But personally, I am often extremely frustrated with these assignments that are supposed to help me learn the course material. To students who haven't used Perusall yet, I strongly encourage you to do your due diligence on how well you do with Perusall, especially for classes where a large portion of the grade comes from Perusall points. It may sound easy at first, but it can cause you unnecessary hours of stress and redundant work.

I'm just glad that when I graduate in May I won't have to deal with this absurd service that distracts me from my learning experience anymore. Good luck everyone.

1522,OOS Financial Aid for Low Income,"So I just received my financial aid package and I have to say, I'm quite impressed. A bit worried, but still impressed considering UMich is an OOS public school.

I received $50k in federal grants, school grants, work-study, and the victors award. According to the UMich financial aid page, the typical tuition for freshmen and sophomores is around $69k. That would mean I would have to find a way to pay $19k. My mother only makes around $18,000 per year, so obviously, I would have to take loans.

My second option(for now) is University at Buffalo. According to their net price calculator, I would have to pay $13k.

Although I'm not expecting this, I was wondering, could I ask the financial aid office for more financial aid, since I'm low-income (EFC is 0) and don't want to overburden myself with this amount of loans?

It's still quite early with the financial aid, so should I expect any more financial aid in the coming few months?

In your opinion, should I consider going to UMich with $19k per year in loans or should I go to UB, my in-state school, with a projected $13k a year in loans? I'm planning on doing a CSE or ECE major, so UMich would be a great choice for me compared to UB. But still, I would like someone's opinion on this.",17,5,uofm,hot

1529,Application response in one week?,"Yo, I’m a sophomore at U of M rn, but today I get a text from a close friend of mine (also a sophomore, but at UM Dearborn) saying she got a response already saying she didn’t get in. I don’t know how this is possible at all, seeing as the whole process takes weeks and that the submitting of transcripts and stuff takes a while to get to the offices and stuff, and she didn’t apply early, this was regular decision.

For full clarification:
-She actually got accepted senior year of high school, but chose not to go for financial reasons.
-She failed some classes freshman year at UM Dearborn, but retook them to where now her gpa is in the 3.0 range.
-She wrote some pretty good essays that she wanted me to look over and thought they were great.

So my question is: are there any cases of U of M rejecting people this early in the process? Or am I being lied to? Another thing, I asked for a screenshot but she said no, and that that’s a little insensitive to ask, which I get but it just doesn’t make any sense to me.

* I use ResumeWorded to tailor my resume for every job I apply to
* All my bullet points are quantified to demonstrate value and impact
* I write cover letters succinctly relating my experience to an org’s business needs
* I have past internships, and currently have two current part-time positions in two different labs resulting in several publications
* I’ve attempted to reach out to alumni and recruiters for informational interviews
* I’ve attended career fairs and followed up with attendees
* I’ve created a LinkedIn profile, set my job preferences, toggled “open to work” and bought LinkedIn Premium

All of this has resulted in these greatest hits of the past academic year:

* A data analysis take-home project designed to be intentionally ambiguous that took me six hours to do and resulted in a rejection and lack of feedback that the recruiter explicitly promised me before I agreed to do the project
* A phone screen that I thought went really well resulting in an inexplicable rejection two weeks later
* An Amazon recruiter reaching out to *me* and ghosting me after I reply
* Zero-explanation rejections before any OA or phone screen after recruiter reached out to me to apply for a specific role
* A phone screen via referral that was going super well until the recruiter mentioned job duties *completely* unrelated to the job description that I admitted wasn’t qualified for resulting in a rejection a week later
* Recruiters at career fairs only interested in funneling applications to their careers page and having nothing to offer to those who pre-applied because they’re only there to collect resumes

1593,Bentley Historical Library Mike Wallace Collection,"Hi, this is a bit odd, but I hope someone will be able to answer my question

I'm a high school junior in Southern California, and I am currently in an economics class. According to my teacher, every year he would show a tape of a 60 minutes segment featuring hyperinflation in Brazil with Mike Wallace as the host, as it pairs with the current unit for AP Macro. 

However, recently, before he was planning to show the tape, it broke, and is no longer able to be used. He mentioned that he thought the tape was located in the University of Michigan library or records of some sorts. Upon searching online for a while, I have not been able to find anything, though I was able to see that a large Mike Wallace 60 minutes collection is located in the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan.

Seeing as I am in Southern California, I obviously can't go down to Bentley on the weekend and see what they have, even if I could get access to these particular resources. Additionally, I saw that on the Bentley website, copying of materials within the collection is not allowed. Even further, looking through what was listed as included in the collection on the website, I could not find something with ""Brazil"" or ""Inflation"" in the title (it may or may not have a different episode title which I don't know, as I couldn't find any references to this particular segment online).

Tomorrow I am interviewing for my dream internship - something that I have wanted to do since I was young. I am *so* excited - expect for one aspect of it.

Do any of you have experience with a similar situation? If so, how did it play out? I'm assuming I could email professors and ask permission to not be automatically dropped from the classes, but are they generally receptive to that? 

If I got offered the position, I would obviously keep up with the material as best as I could. There aren't typically labs or discussions in the first week anyway, so I don't think I would miss a lot with that.

I'm a freshman who recently decided to change his major from economics to computer science. I want to do a cs major and econ minor now.

1603,1 credit Mini courses with a lot of work required (Medical Terminology),"One 1 credit mini course (Medical Terminology) that I am in right now runs semester long and it meets once a week (online right now but instructor is pushing for in person). Every week we have a list of vocab words to memorize for the quiz the following week, and a homework assignment to do that combines roots we have not learned and are expected to look up. The homeworks are not easy, and your answer has to be word for word to get credit. The homework itself easily takes me over an hour and a half to do since we have to look up words and be spot on in the answer, and on top of that memorizing the new words and rules to make terms takes a lot of time. So far, this is a ton of work for a 1 credit course. Right now our online quizzes are just for practice, but if we go back in person they will count for a grade. Our instructor really wants us to go back in person and is telling us the mid term and final exam will be in person and like the homework assignments are (but closed book and closed notes). 

I know that I am not the only person in this class that is frustrated with how hard this course is for only being 1 credit. Is there a way that we can petition the course to be worth more than 1 credit given the workload? Or are there any suggestions for reaching out to the instructor about the course requirements without sounding like a dick?

1617,I'm just at my limit,"I seriously thought that SI would be like, my perfect major: Tech, people, creativity, totally up my alley!

But, these last two semesters, I've just felt an acceleration of my burn out. And, this isn't a post to shit on SI specifically. To explain, I spend 8 years working my ass off after high school to try and become independent, because behind me was the debilitating anxiety that I'd be stuck with my toxic, enmeshed, dysfunctional family forever if I failed. (A long path of CC, trade school, then CC again led me here).

Well, I tried CS, failed at it, now in SI as that felt more my thing. I got excited enough I started studying last summer . .. and I can now say, I'm not learning a whole lot that's expanding what I studied over the summer, through very ineffective methods. and so I'm incredibly bored and burnt out. I want to go into Customer Success or Solution Engineering or something of that sort, but because I'm burnt out and take forever to stir the motivation to get anything done, I can't get through my school work fast enough to work on those career skills. I'm staying up till like 2AM as that's how long it takes me to get my brain to focus and complete the work of jsut 1 class. It's not too much, my brain is jsut really slow.

So, I'm just really, really friggin depressed, shit feels hopeless, I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. Will work spark any joy in me? I have an IBM BA internship, it's rare I feel excited for it. I'm just wondering if that will spark excitement or satisfacyion. I know a large part of that question depends on me, I have a lot of trauma to work through but Medicaid doesn't really cover proper trauma therapists in AA. The one I finally got to contact and start talking to, she got rejected because she was in Brighton. Again, that added layer of sticky depression and burn out makes things feel dreary and hopeless.

CAPS won't touch me since I have a therapist and they aren't equipped to handle trauma anyway. I'm just tired, man.

Clubs? Hard to get into. I have audio processing disorder so it's hard to communicate with people and have a good time. I'm half deaf on top of it. This was always an issue, I just finally have a name for it.

I've been able to talk to people, it's just a struggle, and probably burdensome on the people involved.

1662,"If you didn't receive an offer from a professional club, REJOICE! Seriously.","**SNIFFFFFFFFFF** Ahh you smell that? A new semester starts and the smell of disappointment and isolation fill the streets of Ann Arbor.

Fret not, fellow nerds. I come from far west with perspective and hope, just in time for the full scale mega winter storm ultra fuck. 

Stay coozy 🥂

Just going to give you all a rundown of my experience as a former member of a few of these clubs:

1. Most of the members and leadership don't want to be there. I'll never understand why there's such a high barrier to entry only to meet with people who half ass every single meeting, and whose only perogative is to extract contacts and information out of you while giving no meaningful experiences in return, whether professional or otherwise. 

2. Employers literally don't give a shit. I've talked to recruiters and executives of small to middles sized businesses and they all told me the same thing: they want students who are entrepreneurial thinkers and robust problem solvers. Google, Goldman, Apple, Tesla Facebook, receive millions of applications a year. Do you REALLY think they give a fuck if you were accepted into some professional campus organization? You decide.

3. The time suck is unbearable. Imagine if you got into a club and hate it, only to stick around for the prestige. It will suck the life out of you and make everything else you have to do in the day just a little bit harder.

4. Club membership dues? For what exactly? I'd rather spend that money on a knish.

5. Club leaders love to lord over there constituents. Like, chill out dude/dudette, I've seen you walk out of the bathroom at skeeps with piss all over your pants.

A little word of advice: build relationships with professionals, not asshole clowns that want to posture. The relationships will be authentic, you'll gain REAL WORLD insight that will help you during an interview, and you will be SO SO SO much happier.

Good luck, and godspeed.

1663,Stats 412 vs. 426,"Hi everybody! I am currently taking Stats 425 since I originally planned to double major in CS and Stats. Now I'm thinking of instead majoring in CS and double minoring in Math and Philosophy. Basically, Stats 425 is a prerequisite for Stats 426, so I can take Stats 412 or 426 next semester to fill the CS requirement.

1691,Tored between UMICH AND UCB for CS,"*Torn

Is the ""prestige"" of UC Berkeley worth the risk of not being able to declare CS at all?

Hi.

I've recently been admitted to UMICH LSA and UC Berkeley L&S for transfer, but I am a bit torned.

I am very aware of the echo on this sub that UC Berkeley is a no-brainer most of the time, but I don't know if it should be the case for me.



Background: I've only recently (Sophomore in college) discovered both my academic interest and financial need in CS (pretty late in the game, I know), so I am basically going into Junior years into the field with minimum knowledge (only started to take Data Structures in this Spring).

For Umich: I can rather easily declare CS with only two classes that need to be taken for C or better grade, and it offers a 5-year undergrad-to-master plan that I can apply to so long that I have a 3.6 GPA- but I digress.


However, for UC Berkeley: I must reach 3.3 gpa AVERAGE for three classes which are INFAMOUSLY hard, even for those who had experience, added to the fact that UC Berkeley also has a reputation of grade deflation. If I am to miss this rather high GPA cutoff (which is likely since I joined mid-game), I won't able to declare the major, so the ""infinite amount of resources to Silicon Valley"" will be pretty much shut to me.

I don't know if the reward of UC Berkeley's connection in the Valley is worth the risk, considering UMICH is also heavily recruited by them too.

1692,Just got beyond screwed over by my roommate.,"So I just wanna preface this by saying this guy has been the bane of my existence for a while.

He was very chill at first, in fact he left a really good first impression on me and we vibed hard for the first couple of weeks/month.

Anyways, we just weren’t as close after that. We still talked but never hung out much, but we were close enough and I had some other friends who I planned on getting an apartment with, but some of them were not sure if they wanted to stay at UofM afterwards, and my other friend’s budget was too low for anything decent.

So my roommate approached me in like mid November, saying he needed a 3rd for his apartment, and I was down. Again, minimal issues at this point other than him just talking on the phone a bit, but nothing much.

We talk about where, and I ask him if it’s cool if I meet the third guy (his friend who I never met). And basically he just says yeah we can all meet up sometime before signing any leases, so I was chill and asked him regularly for updates because at this point I was hoping to finalize something by the end of November. By the end of the month he’s still “talking with the other guy,” and planning stuff. At this point, I’m not even asking too much so much as he’s giving me updates and asking if I’m still in.

Flash forward, by the end of winter break, I fly back in ( a few days late cuz I got Covid and had to stay home). I’m surprised with his girlfriend there. She’s staying the whole week and he never asked me because “he forgot” and didn’t realize I never was asked. I let it slide cuz at that point I just couldn’t do anything and didn’t wanna start anything.

That same day, he asks if I’m still good for the apartment, I say yes (really rethinking my plans), but I’ve got no other options At this point so I move on and we are still planning on rooming.

NOW, not even a week later I start hearing things which make me confused. (For context I wear noise canceling headphones and usually tune out whatever he says on the phone, but when I hear my name I tend to notice (cocktail party effect)). I hear him say that me and him were planning on housing next year, but “we just forgot over time so we aren’t really doing that anymore”. I was shocked to hear this, he approached me and we were still set to house at that point. I ask him later that day (as to not make him think I’m listening in on his conversations like a creep), and he says yeah “we’re still good just waiting on more stuff from the third guy”.

Fast forward two days later (Friday), and I hear him mention how he’s already working on a leasing contract, I’ve heard nothing of this and ask him what’s going on, he says “my dad neeeded an example contract” or some BS. At this point I realize he’s been planning out an other arrangement with a whole different group and just didn’t tell me. Now today I’ve received confirmation as i heard him mention the depositi has been placed when he talked to his mom.

Just to test  him I asked what’s going on, and same BS, “still waiting on guy 3” but this 
time he says he’s not sure if this is going to work 100% and to not turn down any other offers I get.

I’m so upset rn and don’t know what to do. Obviously I need to find other housing and will get on that asap, but I really wanna chew him out and don’t know the best way (been more conservative in college and don’t just impulsively do things like in high school).

Any advice? (Still need to see this bots face for 3 months)

I took wayyy too many credits last semester (like I got an exception to take 22 cress and they seriously shouldn’t have let me take that many) and I think it has something to do with burn out as well. I also have a job offer lined up and don’t plan on going to grad school or anything so GPA doesn’t REALLY matter, but obviously I still want to finish strong — it’s just not reflect in my effort this semester so far, and I can’t really find the motivation to put school first right now. I just want to be social and go on vacation when I can bc most of my classes are online/asynchronous for now, which is all I’ve been doing.

1704,looking for like minded people,"I'll keep this short: I've found the LGBT spaces and groups on campus to be very alienating, and the reason comes at no surprise- it's incredibly politicized. And being politicized wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if it was welcoming of different political values and ideas, except it's just one big liberal bubble. 

So anyone like myself, who isn't liberal, feels ostracized. From a space that was apparently meant for me? 

Some background info: I've grown up liberal. I've been a liberal until very recently. And I've been involved with  these lgbt groups so I'm very familiar with their values and how they operate. I've been more into revolutionary politics in recent years and found myself disagreeing with many liberal political strategies and ideals and this is where the problem comes. Apparently ""dissent"" translates to ""violent aggressor"" in these spaces so I'm not welcome. neither is anyone else who dares to be themselves and speaks of their values.

 (If you want an example, last semester a freshman gay person made a post on reddit expressing similar discomfort with ideological issues and people came at him pretty hard. Poor guy had to delete his post and his account) some of the things I and many of my friends have discomfort with is the heavy language policing, identity politics, and dominance of postmodern ideologies. 

This shouldn't be the case. If it's an LGBT space, it should be for LGBT people, regardless of their political values. Gay Republicans, lesbian libertarians, trans Republicans, bisexual socialists- it shouldn't matter. 

But unfortunately it does, and that's very disappointing and frustrating. I want to know if other homosexual or transsexual people have felt similarly.

Edit: I realize the title is pretty ironic considering I'm championing diversity of thoughts lol. I just want to see if others have had similar experiences/feel similar.",158,52,uofm,hot

1789,Fuck mdining,"This is literally just a rant, nothing else. I've been working for Mdining consistently since 2018. I was hired at $10, and through their system of giving 25¢ raises a semester was at $11 by the time covid hit. Last year was sporadic and I switched locations a ton based on who was open, and I didn't get any raises due to the wage freeze, which I didn't love but at least understood. I didn't plan on coming back this year, but my manager asked if I'd at least come help train the new people, which I agreed to. I ended up just staying on the schedule, and decided I might as well finish my time at college at the same place I started.

Halfway through last semester, I found out everyone had gotten a dollar raise, bumping the starting pay up to 11, with all the ""experienced"" people making more. I hadn't gotten the raise. When I complained to my manager she said something about how because I was technically just there to train I'd been ""lost in the shuffle."" I complained some more and eventually got bumped up to $12, with about two weeks of back pay at this rate. This is still lower than most places on campus, of course, but it tracks for this location at least. 

I finally turned in my two week notice and had my last shift today. During this shift I was talking with the new guy (hired two weeks ago, essentially my replacement), and found out he was also making $12. Apparently they bumped starting pay up another dollar this semester while leaving everyone else's pay the same. I get that they're trying to get more employees, but my manager keeps complaining about high turnover and seems to have no idea why it's happening. I'm glad they're finally raising starting pay this year (although it's still way too little), but is my four years of experience worth nothing? I'm good enough to train new people but not get paid any more than them? I had to walk the student manager through her job today knowing I'm making $2 less than her, despite her starting last semester. I was the oldest/most experienced employee at the location and asked to be promoted multiple times, but whatever. I don't know. I'm glad some people are making more, just wish I was too. I'm considering emailing my (now ex) manager asking about back pay but I doubt anything will come from it.

I'm an astrophotographer and when I learned as an incoming freshman a couple years ago that we get Adobe Creative Cloud licenses that gives us access to everything, I was ecstatic because Photoshop is ridiculously expensive but it a very helpful editing software for astrophotography. Lately, and this could be something wrong with Windows 10 saving application cache data or something else that's random, but I've been having to sign in to Photoshop every single time I open it, and whenever I sign in, I sign in with my university credentials (it prompts you to our typical U of M login with our uniqID and password and then has you two-factor authenticate) and every time I click ""Remember me for 7 days"" it never remembers me. To top it off, every time I open an image file in Photoshop, it will open it (as normal) and crash within seconds. I think it might not even be crashing, but maybe auto-closing as a safety feature for people who try to pirate the software or share accounts, so whenever it logs me out, it likely auto-closes Photoshop.

I have no clue why this is happening. At first I thought that I might need to update Photoshop, so I opened Creative Cloud just to learn that I also have to sign in again every time I open Creative Cloud. Anyone have any ideas? Any help is appreciated, as I can't do any editing without Photoshop.",2,0,uofm,hot

1815,Consequences of W on transcript,"Note: I am in LS&A

I dual enrolled Calc 3 in high school.  Only come Winter registration and the registration site tells me I'm missing my MATH215 prerequisite.  It turns out that Michigan erroneously put it on my transcript as something called ""Math 201X"" which is like a departmental credit.  This seemed wrong to me because the transfer credit website said it (Math 240 from Schoolcraft College) transfers as MATH215.  Anyways, after a bunch of back and forth I finally get an email from the math transfer credit people telling me it's accepted.  The only problem is that I got that email today (I emailed last Thursday), a day after the drop deadline.  So obviously I do not want to take MATH215 any more because I already will have the credits for it.  I know you can get a late drop without a GPA penalty as long as its approved but the website seems to show it will marked as a ""W"" with basically no exceptions.  Is there any actual consequences to this?  I don't even know what it would look like on my transcript.  Would there be a MATH215 (W) under Undergraduate LS&A and then under transfer courses be a regular MATH215?  Would this negatively effect me in any way?  I emailed my counselor about it but people here never respond to their emails very quickly which makes me think I should just submit the late drop request now and try to get the W removed later.",5,1,uofm,hot

""Class"" of 2017 here.

Despite walking at graduation, I never graduated. Some shitty stuff happened to me my senior year and I kind of just tanked mentally which lead to not graduating. I took an extra semester (was on a full scholarship and had to pay full out of state), and came in two classes shy of graduating. I'm still in good standing with a perfectly acceptable GPA etc.

I started a successful company in 2018 and never looked back and the aim to graduate kind of just passed me by.

The recent college football run kind of opened my eyes to how much trauma there is between me and Michigan, cause I had a hard time pretending I cared after being a die-hard fan the 4.5 years I spent in Ann Arbor.

I want to do my last couple classes and get my damn diploma. If not for me, for my parents (I was on a full scholarship but that doesn't mean they care any less about the fact that I don't have a diploma).

I have a really hard time mentally getting back into communicating with UMich and reopening this trauma. I'm basically looking for a current student (bonus points if you're in the School of Kinesiology) to help me navigate what exactly I have to do, who I need to speak to, and what classes I can take to make this happen. I'll pay you $500, $250 upfront and $250 once I finish the classes. I'm sort of a public figure so I can't screw you over or you can cancel me lol.

That is totally understandable and I'm not mad at you at all.

I'm talking about people who just ignore emails for days on end and never reply when a deadline is approaching. For reference, I'm in a class where we have a group assignment due Tuesday. I sent an email on Friday asking when we should start the project. Only one person answered, and then when I replied asking what their availabilities are so we can meet over zoom, they never replied. It's been 3 days. I sent another email about ideas I have for the project and still nobody replied.

Now is it that hard to type a one sentence answer and click the send button? I'd like to think not. Is it annoying being the one waiting for everyone's replies until the hour before a huge assignment is due? Yes. I genuinely have no idea why there are so many people in this school who find it hard to communicate during projects, with even a single word being ok as opposed to silence. If someone can enlighten me in the comments please do so. Meanwhile I will probably be the one who will do most of the project. Again.",210,15,uofm,hot

It is important to remember that Marschall was hired by Schlissel to radically downsize the Michigan medical system.  Marschall outsourced this effort to Mulholland.  This has resulted in dramatic discontent amongst faculty and staff because toxic leadership creates a toxic work environment.   Patients have suffered as a result.  This started several years before Covid.

Make no mistake, Marschall is a Schlissel man.  

Now Marschall is distancing himself from Schlissel.

The system and it's patients cannot heal until Marschall and the people he has placed in power are gone.  The sooner this happens, the more quickly we can put the Schlissel disaster behind us.

What makes me really confused is that it is difficult to find an intern in a big tech that can offer H1B in the future without having any internship experience. But small start-ups usually can't let me in to just gain experience because they are actually aiming at a future full-time worker and most of them can't offer us international students h1b to work full time in the future. So they won't consider us in the first place. That seems a dilemma for us.

Hi, my name is William and I am currently a student at the University of Michigan. I wanted to start studying English in earnest and found out that there is a Conversation Partner Program offered by the University (https://conversation-partners.lrc.lsa.umich.edu//records.php?lang=English). However, I couldn't find any Language Exchange group at UofM.

Recently, I tried to find a native/advanced English student who wants to learn Korean. At the same time, I would love to teach Korean (as my native language) who wants to learn Korean/interested in learning Korean (a kind of language exchange study). 

One of the possible ways to study language is that I am going to talk using English while you talk with Korean (or vice versa). Also, we teach/correct language skills (e.g., intonation, accent, grammar, and so on), which helps us a lot to be sounded more native. In addition to those, any kind of study is very welcome! 

To explain myself, I came to the US 4 years ago and my native language is Korean (English level is Intermediate)
My hobbies are playing the piano/Tennis.
Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree at UofM in Engineering, living in Ann Arbor now.

1919,This school makes me self-conscious,"I doubt I'm alone in feeling this way, just want to get it off my chest. It seems like 99% of the people here are naturally attractive and/or put full effort into their appearance every day. I'm constantly surrounded by people looking their best, and it makes me feel like I need to do the same. I spent at least 20 minutes this morning deciding on an outfit because everything I put on felt too basic or unflattering. I feel ugly compared to everyone else here, and I worry that people won't like me if I don't look presentable enough. Realistically I know that isn't the case, but the thoughts still cross my mind. It's hard to not feel self-conscious here.

Not to mention, I just started here and I'm still trying to establish a routine. I live off-campus so I do a lot of walking, but I've been struggling to eat enough because of time. Between those things, I think I'm losing weight and my clothes are starting to not fit. So not only do I hardly own stuff that is deemed presentable here, but the clothes I do like don't fit anymore. 

Any advice on how to not feel this way, or at least how to deal with it?",256,7,uofm,hot

1924,Questions about Transfer life and worries!,"Hi everyone, I am a current freshman at MSU hoping to transfer into UofM. While I absolutely love MSU, I really don't feel academically challenged as much and the some parts of the life here aren't really what I'm looking for. I am curious about a few things and I hope you guys can give me a hand :)  


1. Joining clubs as a sophomore. How easy is it? I have heard a lot of things in this sub relating to transfers having a really hard time getting into clubs so I am a bit nervous! Extracurriculars are a huge thing for me.
2. Transfer Credit. Thankfully, my credits all transfer in but do you all think it might be worth retaking a class. I am taking an intro CS class at MSU and I feel like I am not really learning much since the class is really terribly put together. I also fear I may have not taken the right writing course that can transfer over (I am taking it at LCC and it may be the wrong section lol) so would I be able to possibly take it over summer or would it just be worth it to take it at UofM/at WCC concurrently at UofM?
3. The big one. So, during covid 2020-2021 (grad year) I had a string of really bad things in my family happen and the loss of reliable income/stability in my family. My grades overall suffered greatly as I went from a rising 3.8ish to a 3.6 in just 3 semesters. I had to move online my second semester of my senior year to take care of my grandma and help my mom. This was by-far my worst academically I've done and my mental health was near 0. Fall semester of college I managed to get a solid 4.0 and land some good positions in clubs and got an internship. How much will they look at the really bad grades in senior year of high school? Is my rebound a factor that will kinda lessen the blow of that? How would I include that to better fit in my resume?
4. The side one. I didn't apply to UofM-Ann Arbor but I did apply to UofM-Dearborn (and got in) because I initially wanted to go there if I felt like I didn't get into OSU or MSU (which were my top schools).  Does that count as applying to UofM even though it wasn't to the flagship campus? (I only ask because on the transfer app it says to put down if you applied to UofM; sorry for the dumb question ahaha)
5. The side side one. Are the squirrels still really fat?

Thank you all! Even if I don't get in I will try again my sophomore semester! Even if that fails I'll just get my masters here ahahaha. I have a deep admiration for UofM as the idea of ""leaders and the best"" kinda resonated with me (as well as spending half of my childhood in A2). Regardless, this is a really really long post and I appreciate you for reading it!  Blue-Green solidarity.",12,1,uofm,hot

1936,Data Science Major for the hell of it???,"So here's my situation. I'm currently a senior and should be graduating at the end of this semester. However, due to changing my major a little late, some health issues I ran into last year, and my pure loathing for online classes, I'm going to need to take another full year. Two extra semesters. 

I am currently double majoring in Actuarial Mathematics and Statistics. It was towards the end of sophomore year (right around the time COVID hit) that I decided a Data Science major wasn't for me, so I switched to Actuarial Mathematics. Kept the Statistics--she's been with me from the start. 

Anyway, here I am screwing around with my class schedules and graduation requirements and I notice that I would literally only have to take TWO extra classes in order to get a DS degree. There's so much overlap between the three (Actuarial, Stats, DS) that courses I've already taken basically completely cover all of the electives and even the Capstone course for Data Science. I would only need to take EECS 281 and then either EECS 484 OR EECS 485 (plus all the other courses I was already planning on taking for my other majors) in order to fulfill my major requirements for DS

I'd be crazy not to, right? I've mapped out my next two semesters and it would just end up being 4 classes per semester, total. So, after this semester ends, I could be 8 classes away from a BS in Actuarial mathematics, statistics, and data science.

Now, I must add, the primary reason I dropped DS in the first place was because I wasn't particularly fond of 280. A big part of that was definitely remote learning though. I feel like if I go into 281 with a no-bullshit attitude and actually take the time to learn and study the material, I can do well. 

I guess I'm just looking for your guys' thoughts, especially considering most of ya'll are EECS students. Is a triple major even possible? Worth it? Would I be better off doing a CS minor instead of a DS major? Or just stick with my current track which is Acturial math + Stats double major and no minor. I meet with my academic advisor soon too, so hopefully he will be able to guide me in the right direction.

2013,My ode to UMich,"I feel like a broken record, but I hope someone understands this rant / reads all of it. 

I transferred to UofM this semester, and I knew since the moment I wanted to transfer from my other small liberal arts college that coming here would be a huge adjustment— not only because of the class rigor but also because of UMich’s sheer size. I knew that finding a group of friends would be hard, but I kept reassuring myself that I’m a social person, and usually after almost a year or so I’m able to find my place. I sorta compared this to high school. My freshman year of high school was so lonely and awful, but come sophomore year, I found a solid group of friends in classes as well as a group to hang out with after school. It’s March and while I’ve met a ton of wonderful people, I don’t have many friends to hang out with or go out with. I want to be close friends with the people in my classes but they only see me as someone to be friends with in class. Most people stick with the people in their sorority/fraternity— which I’m not involved in nor ever wanted to be. I became close friends with one person who is younger than me, and I hung out with this person so much that I felt like it prevented me from going out and meeting other people. I look on social media at people and friends who go to other prestigious schools like Cornell, UPenn, and Boston U who seem to be networking and hanging with so many amazing people from all over the world. And I’m stuck in my apartment along doing work most nights. I just thought I would share my experience so far. Sometimes, I think to myself, I just can’t wait to graduate.",105,14,uofm,new

1.) What does EECS even stand for?

3.) How could an auto grader possibly work? Like how does it know if you did the assignment right?

4.) Why is the honor code so much stricter and more stressful sounding than for humanities and social science classes?

> There’s no GB marking. The KN95 standard requires that masks made after July 1, 2021, be stamped with GB2626-2019, which provides reassurance that the manufacturer constructed the mask according to current Chinese respirator standards, Miller said.

Prepare for the reality of social work jobs to be rolled into nursing as part of that systemic disenfranchisement. As a social worker within I have been witness to this. Over the years we have lost supervisory positions and more to nurses who despite their education and training assuredly are not representative of Social Work. In turn, nurses need to refer to an ample (not barely adequate) social work department and need not be expected to do more than nursing. By all means, go to the nursing groups on reddit to see how they seem uneducated about the availability of social work for support.  How they are overwhelmed and burnt out dealing with patient psychosocial issues. Prepare for the reality that any clinician believes they can do social work. Prepare for admin to support those beliefs. Has anyone compared the percentage of social workers employed within UMich now in comparison to previous years?  Look at the lack of ethical/morale decision making within the UMich hierarchy. Social workers have spoken of DEI for years.  DEI is high priority at Mich Med NOW but the very profession that has advocated for years and years are not valued despite this. Many social workers are placed in situations where clearly they need a union(as nurses have).  Ask yourself, how on earth did Social Workers manage to ensure they are completely unprotected?  Not one social worker within UMich dare attempt to unionize. That, more than anything shows how weak, useless and afraid we have become. If you speak up, yo are a problem, are “at will” and can easily be fired.  Social workers have been weakened from within, exemplifying the state of affairs in NASW, Schools of Social Work, Michigan and the country. We are “sold an education” and are in debt for years. We are underpaid and are beholden to employers for our pay. There is no dual responsibility. You are solely responsible to your employer. Systems in Michigan are broken and they break down social workers. We now mirror the institutions and are no longer agents of change. Come, take my position as I am preparing to end my social work career.  Step into my job similar to indentured servitude. Speak softly and upset no-one.  My last words of advice: if you want to help and make a change, be a nurse. To all schools of social work: be a department within allied health. Social Work is a concept, not a career.",0,0,uofm,new

I am an incoming freshman in the fall admitted to LSA, planning on an Econ and Data Science double major for the time being and was wondering about MCSP.

How is the time commitment and what do you think about the environment of it? Is there any advice you would give? I do have an actual interest in joining and am not applying to try to guarantee housing on Central Campus because MCSP lives in West Quad.

2078,Pre-CAA Club,"We made a club for those at Wayne who share the goal of becoming a certified anesthesiologist assistant (CAA). The profession is fairly niche, so I figured I’d extend the invite to other Michigan unis. Hope that’s not an issue!

Here’s a link for the 
discord - https://discord.gg/YqwYmPPE

WhatsApp- https://chat.whatsapp.com/H4Xm0cGREBY7JIxfngLWu0

It’s a relatively unknown profession so I’ll  elaborate

1- What is a CAA?

Certified anesthesiologist assistants are anesthesia midlevels who assist anesthesiologists in anesthetizing patients. For those who are familiar with CRNAs, CAAs are also anesthetists who provide anesthesia for patients during surgery. Unlike CRNAs, CAAs must be supervised by anesthesiologists in their work setting. CAAs are to CRNAs what PAs are to NPs. The dynamic is almost identical.

2-What exactly is their scope of practice and responsibilities?

CAAs create and implement anesthesia plans, place arterial lines, intubate, secure airways, push drugs and manage vitals during surgery, and extubate. All of this is done under a ACT model where an anesthesiologist is supervising around 2 to 4 anesthetists, going from OR room to OR room. CAAs can also administer regional anesthesia/nerve blocks under close physician supervision.


3- How does one become a CAA?


To become a CAA, one has to obtain a 28 month long masters degree from one of the 13 accredited CAA schools. To receive entry into CAA school, applicants will have to complete a schools pre req list some time before matriculation, take the GRE or MCAT, show demonstrations in volunteering, PCE, and/or research, and interview well.

4- Why isn’t this profession more well known?


The AA profession came to the anesthesia field a century after nurse anesthetists were incepted. In an attempt to protect their job market interests, the AANA (lobbying organization for CRNAs) have relentlessly rallied and lobbied for the barring of AA practice rights in the majority of states through the use of fallaciously construed arguments aimed at layman politicians who know no better. As of now, CAAs can practice in these locations and states: Kansas, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado,Vermont, Washington DC, Guam, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, and North Carolina.

5-How well is this profession compensated?


CAAs make wages comparable to what CRNAs who work in the ACT earn. New grads can make anywhere from 150k to 200k base W2s for 40 hours of work a week depending on which part of the country they are situated in. The less desirable the locale, the better paid typically. More can be made for those who take call and work OT (multipliers are typically applied to both). Base pay progresses and scales up as one becomes more experienced. Base caps vary depending on the work setting. For more salary info, checkout gasworks.com. Average cost of attendance for this pathway tends to be around 120k 

6- Why does this club need to exist?

The AA profession is a very niche one that has barriers to entry and qualities unique to it. For example, unlike most other health profession interviews, AA schools ask questions and expect inquiries that demonstrate a applicants understanding of the specificities of the profession. For example, basic understanding of the process of how anesthesia is administered , the name and effect of specific anesthetics you’ve seen, and the political landscape of the profession can all be questions brought up throughout one’s interview. The better someone understands these topics the better their interview performance will be. There are other ways that the AA admission process notably differs from other health professional programs, thus warranting differing prep and advice in comparison to the general rules of thumb in other pre health clubs. I’d be happy to elaborate in the comments if anyones more curious. And it’s always great to be surrounded by others who have the same end goal in mind.",17,2,uofm,new

Another man yelled at me after I didn’t buy a newspaper “you go here and you don’t have two dollars”. I’ve bought several of them before… just not from him… I also had a homeless man watch me in a cafe for an hour (from outside the window) and then followed me down the block asking questions in broad daylight until I literally ran away. I’m not sure if this is just my experience but i’m beginning to loose a bit of my empathy and I don’t want to.,118,10,uofm,new

Everything in this post should be obvious, but as a student instructor, I don't want any students impacted by this to feel like they can't / shouldn't reach out to instructors for help.

&#x200B;

It's basically impossible to miss at this point, but Russia and Ukraine are at war. We have students (and faculty) from both Ukraine and Russia, and for many of them the war may be a huge stressor on top of coursework. It may be reasonable to say the same for students from other countries in eastern Europe, although I'm not familiar enough with regional politics to say confidently. I don't know how many students there are from the affected countries, but they are here and we should acknowledge whatever needs may arise.

It would be cruel to force students with this kind of stress to also have to deal with significant course-based stressors. Speaking as a student instructor, **if you're an IA/GSI/professor, please be lenient on accomodations for students affected by the Russo-Ukrainian war.**

I admit I don't know how to make those accomodations -- virtue signalling is easier than actually helping people. It would be blatantly inappropriate to ask for students' nationalities to ""verify"" something. I don't think there's much instructors can *actively* do besides possibly 1. increase accomodations for everyone and/or 2. write a message to students emphasizing leniency on accomodations. (For the latter I'm worried it would come out politically charged and cause controversy of its own accord -- I might be worrying too much there?). However, we can at least *reactively* accomodate students who reach out about this. It's better to give accomodations to someone trying to game accomodations than to refuse accomodations for someone who is genuinely suffering.

My friend applied to UofM and everything went smoothly so far. He got his transcripts in on time, submitted his CommonApp application on time, the whole shabang.

This Sunday (Feb 20), he was notified that he had a missing transcript from a university overseas. Okay no problem, he just submitted his transcript the next day (Monday morning, Feb 21).

Then... Tuesday (Feb 22) afternoon, he was notified that he had an application update. He and I we're excited, but when we opened the letter up... it said his application was cancelled. :(

I did some research and called the umich admission office and they told me that all transcripts were due on the Feb 15. But until Feb 20, the enrollment connect website said ""No additional materials required"" or something like that. So why would the admission office let my friend know that he had something missing until AFTER the DEADLINE? Is this a fair to my friend?

Oh and by the way, he was a visiting student at the overseas university and he only took **one** class that was not transferable to umich anyways.

2162,A Rant About EECS 203,"I love discrete math more than anyone and if this wasn't such a horribly taught class, it might actually be my favorite from this semester. Btw this is just my personal opinion of the class and isn't meant to hate anyone, just criticism.

Let's talk about the topics. Discrete math is one of the most important courses in CS which is why it is a requirement for all CS majors, and has major applications in algorithms, cryptography and data science. However, none of this was discussed in the class, instead it feels like we are jumping from random topics to other random topics almost like a slideshow speedrun. One week we are doing modular arithmetic, the next week its logical equivalences, and the next we are somehow at sets. It feels like we are just barely learning about one topic, and the next we are at a totally different topic. I never feel like I am learning the material in depth and thoroughly understanding its applications and importance.

Then there are the lectures for the course. The lecturers are all very nice people, but other than Gratez, they seriously can't teach. At one point, I had to skip Gratez's lectures on natural deduction because I procrastinated too much on a 280 project, and couldn't find their lecture recordings (It was probably there somewhere, I'm just too dumb to find it) so I decided to try some of the other professors recordings. They just read information from slides and do problems without really explaining what was going on. Take F-elim for example. The reason why F-elim works is that if you know either A or B is true, and you know that A is false, then it follows that B has to be true otherwise it would contradict the first statement. However, instead of explaining this, they decide to present F-elim along with 16 other different rules with strange symbols and assumption boxes that I couldn't make sense of since I was becoming so overwhelmed from them talking about each rule in a single sentence and jumping to the next rule. The concepts are actually really easy but the logical reasoning behind how/why each rule works was never properly explained. I went to Regan's OH and learned more about natural deduction in 30 minutes than from two 1.5 hour lectures and walked away with natural deduction being my new favorite topic, but this really shouldn't be happening.

The homeworks, while being ok, shouldn't be graded on accuracy. Homework is supposed to be part of the learning process, when you learn from your mistakes etc, yet they are graded like tests. In other classes like math or chem or physics you get multiple tries and hints so that you can learn the concepts but in 203 if you get the initial concepts wrong, you will probably lose a large chunk of your grade for that assignment. It just feels very disheartening for students who have initial struggles with the concepts and are trying very hard to learn the material.

Overall, I think the content of the class itself is very fun and interesting and I recommend even non CS majors to take the class just for the fun content. I really enjoyed the group homework because a lot of the problems feel like mind games which have really neat and clever solutions. I also think it is one of the easier STEM classes at umich, much easier than Math 116 even though that class was taught better. However, there are so many flaws with this class that could be easily fixed (having less topics and instead spending more time on each topic, teach the concepts and not the rules, fixing the homework, letting us know the applications etc) so I'm just going to post my rant here cus I feel like it.",64,15,uofm,new

I have a midterm exam on Wednesday that is going to be administered on Gradescope, as many exams have been for the past two years since the pandemic started. The instructors have posted that the exam should take us 80 minutes to complete and that they're giving us an extra 40 minutes for submission time. Well, I just took the practice exam and let's just say there is no chance I was going to finish that thing in 80 minutes and 120 minutes would be cutting it close. I have attended all lectures and done well on homework and quizzes up to this point although I just started formally studying today.

This isn't the first class I've had this issue either where you're given an exam time estimation with a submission buffer. I get that we're given 120 minutes total for the exam, but outside of an absolute horror story, I doubt it should take anyone more than 20 minutes to upload their written portions to Gradescope. What bothers me is why not just say the exam should take 100 minutes and 20 minutes of submission? There's no question exams have gotten more difficult since classes went remote in order to offset cheating, but thinking (or pretending) they should still take us the same amount of time  as they did pre-pandemic is absurd, especially for those who don't use external resources. 

Either a) the course staff genuinely thinks these exams should take the students as long as they say, which is extrememly tone deaf, or b) they are just covering themselves assuming students will work past their ""estimation"" and can say ""well we gave you 40 minutes to submit"" if a student doesn't submit in time even though the exam actually takes longer than what they said to complete. I've noticed this in a lot of my classes and although I've never had an issue submitting on time, its just kind of annoying.

I am in a situation where I'm unsure whether or not I want to participate because of the 5-week summer program requirement, so I am currently weighing the pros and cons.

Do M-Engin students have a significant leg up in terms of internship/research/co-op opportunities compared to students who maintain a high-enough GPA and take advantage of the opportunities at the EAC(engineering advising center) and ECRC(engineering career resource center)?

Do the courses taken during the 5-week program before freshman year provide significant help in getting you accustomed to courses or can non-M-Engin students still become accustomed similarly quickly given regular class attendance and revision outside of the classroom?

I guess I don't want to miss out on opportunities that can support me both academically and career-wise and I want to know if M-Engin is one of those critical experiences that can make a huge difference during my time at CoE. Please share your thoughts on this matter.

2354,Please Consider Supporting Inter-Cooperative Council Members [more info below + comments]," Dear Community Members, Cooperative Partners, and Supportive Citizens,

**Please accept \[another\] shameless plug to donate to the Inter-Cooperative Council to help support members who are struggling financially due to the pandemic.** [This is the link to our Go Fund Me page which describes our goals](https://gofund.me/501f0ea8). Every dollar will go directly towards a member who has demonstrated financial need as a result of the pandemic. Many of our members are low-income, working students and many have been disproportionately affected by covid19, and communal housing poses unique risks during the pandemic. Although the Omicron variant was generally less unpleasant than earlier strains, the highly contagious nature of it means we have had many folks who entered quarantine housing and took time off work as a result.

**Who Are We?**

The Inter-Cooperative Council, Ann Arbor is a 503(c) non-profit that provides affordable housing to primarily students, though we have plenty of non-student members too. Our organization is 76 years old and contains roughly 550 members distributed across 16 houses. We are a voluntary, open-membership organization that runs democratically by the will of the members. We are dedicated to fair & equal housing, housing affordability, and race/class/gender/nationality/climate/sustainability justice. We run our community according to a set of cooperative principles and share in house labor. Group meals and “guff” (meaning: for anyone, a communal good) food is purchased with money that house members pool together. Many properties have fun, miscellaneous amenities such as pool tables, communal TVs/appliances, and entertainment subscriptions. For many members current and former, our community and houses are home. I’m one of those members for sure.

**How has the ICC fared during the Pandemic?**

Thank you for asking, that's very sweet of you <3

Our membership has remained resilient, flexible, and compassionate during the pandemic, as is to be expected from such a fine group of passionate people. We have worked overtime to get our houses full, and in service to that, have implemented many covid19 safety policies to ensure our houses can stay full.

We created a member-run committee, the Covid19 Task Force, which meets regularly to keep abreast of the ever-shifting landscape that is the pandemic and recommend policies and action steps the ICC can take to keep our community safe. We have our Covid19 Scholarship (the whole reason for this post), which can be accessed by any member needing assistance during this time. All of our organizational meetings and trainings take place over zoom to mitigate the spread between houses. We have intermittently implemented large gathering moratoriums to respond to pandemic trends and case spikes. Most recently, we bulk ordered and distributed n95 masks to all of our members to keep them as safe as possible during the omicron wave (thank you so much to U of M's student government for giving us a grant for this!).

2359,"To those looking at taking EECS 441 with Soloway, here's what you'd be getting into","I'm in this class right now - so, granted, I haven't experienced it through the end. But there's hardly anything else on Reddit about this course/professor so I'd like to relay my experience so far.

**Course Content**

The course title is ""Mobile App Development for Entrepreneurs"". In the first week of classes, Soloway put emphasis on the ""Entrepreneurs"" part of this title and stressed that there will not be any technical or programming lectures - rather, the content would be based around the entrepreneurship component. He goes great lengths to make this clear in the syllabus, where he plucks out excerpts from previous semesters’ student feedback and defends himself against them (not a great first impression).

That all being said, we've had a total of one (or arguably two) actual substantive lectures so far - and there are three classes a week. The approximate breakdown of how class time has been spent so far is as follows:

* 10%: meaningful lectures
* 30%: class-wide discussion of current events in the tech world
* 60%: student presentations

Despite very explicitly being a class about the entrepreneurial side of app development, there has been precisely zero discussion so far as to core concepts/ideas as fundamental as finances or marketing. ""How could our app idea be monetized?"" is a completely nonexistent subject, to the point where project groups are presenting app ideas that are superior to existing competitors because ""ours will be free"", and Soloway just... accepts that reasoning.

Student's grades are almost entirely about delivering \~7 different presentations throughout the semester, and less so about the substance of those presentations or what they actually produce as their final project. For example, making your company analysis presentation exactly eight minutes in length (with a 15-second margin for error provided) is a significant part of your grade. *At best*, this has been a public speaking course with technology as a background theme.

**Unclear Expectations**

In each presentation, Soloway is seeking something very specific. But these expectations are never quite clear and seem to change on a whim.

You're gonna start the class, and Soloway will tell you that your first presentation must be exactly eight slides, with such-and-such content on each slide, and exactly four minutes in length. You're gonna think to yourself, ""I dunno what that Reddit person was going off about, Soloway told us exactly what we need to do"". Then the day of the presentation is gonna roll around, and he'll say at the last minute that *everyone is now required to skip slide 7* because ""slide 7 is all bullshit anyways"" (actual quote). How in the hell were you supposed to prepare for that when practicing to meet the exact four-minute requirement?

The real difficulty of this class comes in simply figuring out what exactly Soloway wants, and providing exactly what he wants. Soloway himself will attest to the difficulty of this: ""I have been known to make EVERYONE redo the second presentation in previous semesters!"", he boasts repeatedly. Anyone who knows anything about anything realizes that failing every single person in a class is a sign of unclear expectations and/or poor teaching, but this thought appears to evade Soloway.

He's right - it's a serious challenge to satisfy him. Any slide anyone presents to him will always have too much text, or too little text, or too many bullets, or too few bullets, or he won't like the picture on it, or you should've said something very slightly different, or this chart has too many words, or this mockup is too complex, or that mockup is too simple, or some other tedious BS. Another great Soloway feature: he criticizes practically every single presentation on these points live in front of the rest of the class, and the presenters are not allowed to respond in any way, ultimately creating an act of humiliation at its finest.

**Unattainable Expectations**

Soloway will freely admit that, although he keeps up to date with the tech world, he lacks any real programming/software engineering skills. That's fine, but a problem arises when he tries to critique projects on their technical merits. He gives you three minutes for you to describe your planned next steps for developing your app on a fairly surface level, then he tries to tell you why this app is either too much or too little work for your group. This has been a consistent theme for almost every group who's ever presented anything thus far; Soloway understands what a database is, but he doesn't appear to understand (for example) that three nearly-identical app screens don't need to be written completely from scratch three times, so in his view your project is too complicated and you'll get a poor grade for your presentation.

The fact that he's grading so heavily on this at all is already a problem, given that he can't possibly know everything about every group's skills, experience, team dynamics, schedules, etc. But he also fails to realize how his own lack of experience harms his judgment in this area, which means many presentations’ grades are effectively a crapshoot.

**Climate Issues**

Already on several occasions this semester, Soloway has been criticized for saying (or allowing others to say) things that are harmful to building a safe an inclusive environment for students of all identities. The most egregious instance of this was when he said loudly in front of one of his sections, ""Oh, women have babies, men have buildings. Right, \[laughing\] I mean, right? We can't, we want to build something. Like a building!"" I don't think I need to explain why this is a horrible and insensitive thing to say, especially given the current climate across CSE as a whole. Soloway later apologized to that section (but not to the other section, all of whom heard about the comment nonetheless).

**The Verdict (so far)**

In almost every way aside from core themes, this course/professor strongly resembles that of a low-quality community college course. As a professor of a CS capstone course lacking technical experience and who is seemingly unwilling to teach about much else, Soloway provides little more value than that of a random community college professor. The overall workload is fairly low, but the work itself is merely a frustrating exercise in decoding the precise desires of a whimsical man. Indeed, the bulk of your time spent doing course work will be spent thinking ""what are Soloway's personal opinions"" and ""how would Soloway react to this"" rather than ""what would the best solution be for this problem"". If you engage in this exercise, you will very likely get a passing grade, but my god is it obnoxious and unproductive.

If you are looking for a capstone course to develop meaningful skills or to learn pretty much anything about anything, I cannot recommend this course. If you just want to pass a capstone course with a relatively low workload, and are cool with handling all the BS above (including the rather alarming climate issues), then this course might be worth looking into.

2393,PHRMACOL 425 How it's structured and what it is like,"*I'm making this post halfway through the semester because I couldn't find any information regarding this course prior to enrolling in it; therefore, I will be putting the information out there. For anyone that finds this post, I was/am enrolled in PHRMACOL 425 during the WINTER 2022 term.*

**The first few weeks:** All of the material for the first exam is structured and relatively easy. The exam itself is open book/open note and students are given the entire day, 6AM-11:59PM, to take the exam on Canvas. There is no homework for the first 2-3 weeks of the course.

**The remainder of the course (so far):** After the first exam, students begin reading research papers, giving presentations, and working for class participation.

* **The presentations:** Students are randomly assigned into groups of 3, then assigned one research paper to present on (so far, the papers have been 7-15 pages). Each group is expected to give a 30 minute presentation, then answer questions regarding their presentation. This occurs three times throughout the semester.
   * **Deficits:**
      * Presentation slides are due on the day that students are giving presentations; therefore, the first groups presenting (group A/B) are given about 4-5 days to prepare- whereas the last groups are given about two weeks to prepare.
      * Papers range from 7-15 pages so some groups have more work to do than others.
      * Groups are randomly assigned each time. If a student is assigned to group A the first time, then they could be assigned to group A the second time. Hypothetically, someone could be given 4-5 days to prepare a 30 minute presentation every time whereas another student might always have 2 weeks to prepare.
   * **Positives:**
      * Grading is very generous, if the paper is read thoroughly and presented in a meaningful way, then it's easy to score 100%.
      * Slides can be wordy. 
      * Students can read directly from the slides (no need to worry about memorizing every word).
* **The participation credit(s):** While some students are presenting, other students are expected to ask questions regarding each paper. Questions can be asked in person or online.
   * **Deficits:**
      * Students posting questions online must read each paper prior to class. Although this is expected of every student enrolled in the course, students asking questions in-person don't technically have to read the papers ahead of time (or at all, technically). 
      * There is no feedback regarding submitted documents/questions; therefore, the grading criteria is unknown- making it difficult to improve on question quality (if that even makes sense). 
   * **Positives:**
      * Students that feel uncomfortable asking questions in class can submit them in a word/pdf document prior to class. For some people, such as myself, this is a far less stressful alternative.
      * Grading is lenient, I haven't gotten less than a 90% for any participation scores.

*I will update this again as the semester progresses. I hope that it doesn't seem too excessive but I love to know exactly what I'm getting myself into when I'm enrolling in each semester and Atlas doesn't offer a whole lot of information.*",34,3,uofm,new

Money is a big factor, as my parents can't help me with college, but UM has offered me a $15,000 Grant, which I'm not sure if it's for one year or all four. So at this point, if would be cheaper to go to U of M.

2421,A unique job or trade for anyone curious in helping with my political violence research,"I’m writing a true crime biography on Ted Kaczynski, and there’s an autobiographical unpublished book written by Kaczynski in a University of Michigan Library Special Collections archive which would be really useful to my writing.

I have a photocopy of it, but I’m missing a few words on various pages where there are photocopy blotches obscuring the text. And I have tried requesting scans from the library staff, but they haven't had the time to explain the various listings and have simply made further scans of photocopy reprints with the same photocopy blotches.

Kaczynski is aged 79 now, and has been transferred to a prison hospital, so may die any day. I know it’s morbid rushing to try and get a book out before someone’s death, even if that person is a serial killer, but I started this project before I knew he was sick and I’d really like to get some mention into the news cycle clearly critiquing his philosophy and explaining his psychology, so that less wayward souls get lost down the eco-fundamentalist rabbit hole.

In return for visiting the University Library and taking photographs of the pages with missing text, I can potentially offer a few of or all these options; payment via paypal, a digital copy of his autobiographical book, a free print copy of my biography and your name credited in the book.

So, if you like the idea and have the time, you can email me at [theosladehome@gmail.com](mailto:theosladehome@gmail.com) and I’ll send you a bunch of free stuff and explain what documents to request and how to find the missing text.

2423,My Parked Car was Hit by a Blue Bus on Campus,"Today while I was in a class, my car was hit and damaged not insignificantly by a UM bus. 

I came out of class to find my car visibly damaged still parked in the street space where I left it. I am afraid this will seriously effect my ability to be on campus and maintain a fairly tight commuting schedule for a demanding semester.

The only real information I have about the actual event came from calling the DPSS number off a card left on my car with a report number. 

Since the class got out at 6:00PM, the DPSS officer on the other end of the phone told me my car was reported hit by a bus while parked and that I have to wait until tomorrow to speak to the officer that filed the report to find out more.

Does anyone know if there is some way I can follow this up with the school? Is there any policy for damage of student property by the University or employees on campus that goes beyond just standard no-fault auto accidents? Many thanks in advance.

UPDATE: Do not have enough coverage for a rental and can not afford to pay for a rental car out of pocket for the duration my car will be gone (estimated a bit over one week, to possibly a few weeks in shop). No means to get to campus yet. I am hoping if I can somehow get a car (borrowing money), I can ask UM parking allow me to make good of the parking pass I paid for to use with my regular vehicle.

I recall a student at orientation talking about getting a free Apple watch for participating in a Umich study tracking heart rates or some shit. I'm a broke ass grad student, so I'm curious what kind of opportunities exist aside from the 100 emails I get about participating in a survey and being entered into a lottery to win a $25 amazon gift card.

2471,"Perusall is Frustrating, Unnecessary, and Hurtful to the Learning Experience","As a second semester senior I have had a lot of experience with Perusall in a variety of classes. I have hit the point where I feel like I need to say something or simply vent. Other students have complained about this as well so I thought I would share my opinion.

If you haven't used Perusall, it's a service that professors use that grades students on annotations on readings. It is usually a recurring assignment that professors have that is paired with the readings for each class/week. You are graded on the quality of your annotations along with the spacing of annotations throughout the reading.

Over the years I have found Perusall assignments to be incredibly frustrating. My frustration stems from the automatic grading system's judgements of my annotations. Sometimes I will leave a comment that I think is very strong and I will not get credit for it, and sometimes I will leave a weaker one and it will give me credit. It is mind-bogglingly inconsistent. There are zero clear criteria that are listed in judging comments, aside from the vague statement that for full credit you have to ""demonstrate thorough and thoughtful reading and insightful interpretation of the reading."" No one knows what this means, and we are left at the mercy of an inaccurate, unreliable program to judge our comments. The program also has no concept of outside material unrelated to that specific reading, so useful comments that connect the current reading to other course materials or real-world examples are almost never given credit. I often find myself having to go back several times through readings that I already fully understand just to find good spaces to leave comments that the mighty Perusall will deem worthy.

The act of having to leave these annotations simply and clearly hurts the learning process. While reading, instead of critically thinking about the meaning and impacts of the subject matter, I find myself far more concerned with the thought of ""How can I turn this into an annotation?"" or ""Is this point spaced out far enough from my last annotation?"" It makes me solely concerned with my grade and the ridiculous spacing requirement, which is not the point of reading. The point of reading is to prepare yourself for assignments/quizzes/exams that affect your grade. Reading is the part of class where you LEARN the material, not get tested on it. Some professors would respond by saying that they use Perusall to make sure that students are keeping up with readings, or that they are trying to award as many points to students as possible. 

To this I say, we are not babies. If you want students to keep up with reading, make your assignments/tests so that doing the reading is rewarded. Have at least a little bit of faith in your students at the #1 public university in America that they will do the reading for a class that they're paying thousands of dollars for. And if some don't, those students will struggle on assessments because they made their choice not to read. If you want to give a lot of points to students like I mentioned above, why not just have simple questions to answer after doing the reading that an actual human who understands the course material can check?

Ah, I know why. Because most profs and GSIs are too lazy to check and grade those assignments.

Maybe this does not apply to some students who just have a better feel for Perusall and know how to game the system and get credit easier. To those people I say, good for you. But personally, I am often extremely frustrated with these assignments that are supposed to help me learn the course material. To students who haven't used Perusall yet, I strongly encourage you to do your due diligence on how well you do with Perusall, especially for classes where a large portion of the grade comes from Perusall points. It may sound easy at first, but it can cause you unnecessary hours of stress and redundant work.

I'm just glad that when I graduate in May I won't have to deal with this absurd service that distracts me from my learning experience anymore. Good luck everyone.

2508,Application response in one week?,"Yo, I’m a sophomore at U of M rn, but today I get a text from a close friend of mine (also a sophomore, but at UM Dearborn) saying she got a response already saying she didn’t get in. I don’t know how this is possible at all, seeing as the whole process takes weeks and that the submitting of transcripts and stuff takes a while to get to the offices and stuff, and she didn’t apply early, this was regular decision.

For full clarification:
-She actually got accepted senior year of high school, but chose not to go for financial reasons.
-She failed some classes freshman year at UM Dearborn, but retook them to where now her gpa is in the 3.0 range.
-She wrote some pretty good essays that she wanted me to look over and thought they were great.

So my question is: are there any cases of U of M rejecting people this early in the process? Or am I being lied to? Another thing, I asked for a screenshot but she said no, and that that’s a little insensitive to ask, which I get but it just doesn’t make any sense to me.

2519,Looking for People to Jam With,"Hey everybody,

I'm a junior here looking for people to play music with in a casual setting. I've played guitar since I was a kid, but didn't start to really enjoy practicing until COVID hit. Over the past few years, I've played quite a lot alone—just soloing over backing tracks, learning songs, running scales, and the like—but I've started to miss the fun of playing with other people. Being a Math & CS major, I'm not exactly looped into any kind of musical scene at U of M so I wasn't sure where to start.

I'm wondering if anyone here knows of places to go or student orgs to join which facilitate jam sessions or something like that. Also, if anyone is in a similar boat and could use a spare guitarist, I'm 100% down. Style-wise, I mostly play rock/blues stuff, with some metal, or occasionally jazz mixed in there, but then again, I'd always be down to try something new ([""samples"" here](https://www.instagram.com/nameerhirschkind/)).

2520,OOS Financial Aid for Low Income,"So I just received my financial aid package and I have to say, I'm quite impressed. A bit worried, but still impressed considering UMich is an OOS public school.

I received $50k in federal grants, school grants, work-study, and the victors award. According to the UMich financial aid page, the typical tuition for freshmen and sophomores is around $69k. That would mean I would have to find a way to pay $19k. My mother only makes around $18,000 per year, so obviously, I would have to take loans.

My second option(for now) is University at Buffalo. According to their net price calculator, I would have to pay $13k.

Although I'm not expecting this, I was wondering, could I ask the financial aid office for more financial aid, since I'm low-income (EFC is 0) and don't want to overburden myself with this amount of loans?

It's still quite early with the financial aid, so should I expect any more financial aid in the coming few months?

In your opinion, should I consider going to UMich with $19k per year in loans or should I go to UB, my in-state school, with a projected $13k a year in loans? I'm planning on doing a CSE or ECE major, so UMich would be a great choice for me compared to UB. But still, I would like someone's opinion on this.",16,5,uofm,new

* I use ResumeWorded to tailor my resume for every job I apply to
* All my bullet points are quantified to demonstrate value and impact
* I write cover letters succinctly relating my experience to an org’s business needs
* I have past internships, and currently have two current part-time positions in two different labs resulting in several publications
* I’ve attempted to reach out to alumni and recruiters for informational interviews
* I’ve attended career fairs and followed up with attendees
* I’ve created a LinkedIn profile, set my job preferences, toggled “open to work” and bought LinkedIn Premium

All of this has resulted in these greatest hits of the past academic year:

* A data analysis take-home project designed to be intentionally ambiguous that took me six hours to do and resulted in a rejection and lack of feedback that the recruiter explicitly promised me before I agreed to do the project
* A phone screen that I thought went really well resulting in an inexplicable rejection two weeks later
* An Amazon recruiter reaching out to *me* and ghosting me after I reply
* Zero-explanation rejections before any OA or phone screen after recruiter reached out to me to apply for a specific role
* A phone screen via referral that was going super well until the recruiter mentioned job duties *completely* unrelated to the job description that I admitted wasn’t qualified for resulting in a rejection a week later
* Recruiters at career fairs only interested in funneling applications to their careers page and having nothing to offer to those who pre-applied because they’re only there to collect resumes

I'm a high school junior in Southern California, and I am currently in an economics class. According to my teacher, every year he would show a tape of a 60 minutes segment featuring hyperinflation in Brazil with Mike Wallace as the host, as it pairs with the current unit for AP Macro. 

However, recently, before he was planning to show the tape, it broke, and is no longer able to be used. He mentioned that he thought the tape was located in the University of Michigan library or records of some sorts. Upon searching online for a while, I have not been able to find anything, though I was able to see that a large Mike Wallace 60 minutes collection is located in the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan.

Seeing as I am in Southern California, I obviously can't go down to Bentley on the weekend and see what they have, even if I could get access to these particular resources. Additionally, I saw that on the Bentley website, copying of materials within the collection is not allowed. Even further, looking through what was listed as included in the collection on the website, I could not find something with ""Brazil"" or ""Inflation"" in the title (it may or may not have a different episode title which I don't know, as I couldn't find any references to this particular segment online).

Does anyone know of a way in which I would be able to get my hands on that particular 60 minutes segment, which may or may not be housed within the University of Michigan Historical Library?

Do any of you have experience with a similar situation? If so, how did it play out? I'm assuming I could email professors and ask permission to not be automatically dropped from the classes, but are they generally receptive to that? 

If I got offered the position, I would obviously keep up with the material as best as I could. There aren't typically labs or discussions in the first week anyway, so I don't think I would miss a lot with that. Also with the added element of lecture capture and recordings I feel like I wouldn't be too behind. (This is super preemptive, of course. I hope I haven't cursed myself by writing it.)",21,1,uofm,new

Maybe I'm used to the generally sub-par meals served in the dining halls, but the food they've given me so far in my quarantine has all been delicious. Several times better than whatever the dining hall is serving. Comes with snacks too.

I'm currently staying in an apartment with a living room (With a couch!... But not much else), table, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom, all to myself. This is a big jump from sharing a dorm room and having to go down the hall into a public room to shower or use the bathroom.

Now, to clarify, my symptoms are very mild, so perhaps my lack of suffering is enabling me to enjoy these things more than someone with a worse case, but for me this is very pleasant.

2600,1 credit Mini courses with a lot of work required (Medical Terminology),"One 1 credit mini course (Medical Terminology) that I am in right now runs semester long and it meets once a week (online right now but instructor is pushing for in person). Every week we have a list of vocab words to memorize for the quiz the following week, and a homework assignment to do that combines roots we have not learned and are expected to look up. The homeworks are not easy, and your answer has to be word for word to get credit. The homework itself easily takes me over an hour and a half to do since we have to look up words and be spot on in the answer, and on top of that memorizing the new words and rules to make terms takes a lot of time. So far, this is a ton of work for a 1 credit course. Right now our online quizzes are just for practice, but if we go back in person they will count for a grade. Our instructor really wants us to go back in person and is telling us the mid term and final exam will be in person and like the homework assignments are (but closed book and closed notes). 

I know that I am not the only person in this class that is frustrated with how hard this course is for only being 1 credit. Is there a way that we can petition the course to be worth more than 1 credit given the workload? Or are there any suggestions for reaching out to the instructor about the course requirements without sounding like a dick? I get that this class is not supposed to be easy, but it is not worth the time it takes me when I have more important classes to study for.

I'm a freshman who recently decided to change his major from economics to computer science. I want to do a cs major and econ minor now.

But, these last two semesters, I've just felt an acceleration of my burn out. And, this isn't a post to shit on SI specifically. To explain, I spend 8 years working my ass off after high school to try and become independent, because behind me was the debilitating anxiety that I'd be stuck with my toxic, enmeshed, dysfunctional family forever if I failed. (A long path of CC, trade school, then CC again led me here).

Well, I tried CS, failed at it, now in SI as that felt more my thing. I got excited enough I started studying last summer . .. and I can now say, I'm not learning a whole lot that's expanding what I studied over the summer, through very ineffective methods. and so I'm incredibly bored and burnt out. I want to go into Customer Success or Solution Engineering or something of that sort, but because I'm burnt out and take forever to stir the motivation to get anything done, I can't get through my school work fast enough to work on those career skills. I'm staying up till like 2AM as that's how long it takes me to get my brain to focus and complete the work of jsut 1 class. It's not too much, my brain is jsut really slow.

So, I'm just really, really friggin depressed, shit feels hopeless, I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. Will work spark any joy in me? I have an IBM BA internship, it's rare I feel excited for it. I'm just wondering if that will spark excitement or satisfacyion. I know a large part of that question depends on me, I have a lot of trauma to work through but Medicaid doesn't really cover proper trauma therapists in AA. The one I finally got to contact and start talking to, she got rejected because she was in Brighton. Again, that added layer of sticky depression and burn out makes things feel dreary and hopeless.

CAPS won't touch me since I have a therapist and they aren't equipped to handle trauma anyway. I'm just tired, man.

Clubs? Hard to get into. I have audio processing disorder so it's hard to communicate with people and have a good time. I'm half deaf on top of it. This was always an issue, I just finally have a name for it.

Fret not, fellow nerds. I come from far west with perspective and hope, just in time for the full scale mega winter storm ultra fuck. 

Stay coozy 🥂

Just going to give you all a rundown of my experience as a former member of a few of these clubs:

1. Most of the members and leadership don't want to be there. I'll never understand why there's such a high barrier to entry only to meet with people who half ass every single meeting, and whose only perogative is to extract contacts and information out of you while giving no meaningful experiences in return, whether professional or otherwise. 

2. Employers literally don't give a shit. I've talked to recruiters and executives of small to middles sized businesses and they all told me the same thing: they want students who are entrepreneurial thinkers and robust problem solvers. Google, Goldman, Apple, Tesla Facebook, receive millions of applications a year. Do you REALLY think they give a fuck if you were accepted into some professional campus organization? You decide.

3. The time suck is unbearable. Imagine if you got into a club and hate it, only to stick around for the prestige. It will suck the life out of you and make everything else you have to do in the day just a little bit harder.

4. Club membership dues? For what exactly? I'd rather spend that money on a knish.

5. Club leaders love to lord over there constituents. Like, chill out dude/dudette, I've seen you walk out of the bathroom at skeeps with piss all over your pants.

A little word of advice: build relationships with professionals, not asshole clowns that want to posture. The relationships will be authentic, you'll gain REAL WORLD insight that will help you during an interview, and you will be SO SO SO much happier.

Good luck, and godspeed.

2661,Tored between UMICH AND UCB for CS,"*Torn

Is the ""prestige"" of UC Berkeley worth the risk of not being able to declare CS at all?

Hi.

I've recently been admitted to UMICH LSA and UC Berkeley L&S for transfer, but I am a bit torned.

I am very aware of the echo on this sub that UC Berkeley is a no-brainer most of the time, but I don't know if it should be the case for me.



Background: I've only recently (Sophomore in college) discovered both my academic interest and financial need in CS (pretty late in the game, I know), so I am basically going into Junior years into the field with minimum knowledge (only started to take Data Structures in this Spring).

For Umich: I can rather easily declare CS with only two classes that need to be taken for C or better grade, and it offers a 5-year undergrad-to-master plan that I can apply to so long that I have a 3.6 GPA- but I digress.


However, for UC Berkeley: I must reach 3.3 gpa AVERAGE for three classes which are INFAMOUSLY hard, even for those who had experience, added to the fact that UC Berkeley also has a reputation of grade deflation. If I am to miss this rather high GPA cutoff (which is likely since I joined mid-game), I won't able to declare the major, so the ""infinite amount of resources to Silicon Valley"" will be pretty much shut to me.

I don't know if the reward of UC Berkeley's connection in the Valley is worth the risk, considering UMICH is also heavily recruited by them too.

If I get in and transfer, I’d probably have to attend for around two years to finish the Information Analysis path BSI program.

2707,Just got beyond screwed over by my roommate.,"So I just wanna preface this by saying this guy has been the bane of my existence for a while.

He was very chill at first, in fact he left a really good first impression on me and we vibed hard for the first couple of weeks/month.

Anyways, we just weren’t as close after that. We still talked but never hung out much, but we were close enough and I had some other friends who I planned on getting an apartment with, but some of them were not sure if they wanted to stay at UofM afterwards, and my other friend’s budget was too low for anything decent.

So my roommate approached me in like mid November, saying he needed a 3rd for his apartment, and I was down. Again, minimal issues at this point other than him just talking on the phone a bit, but nothing much.

We talk about where, and I ask him if it’s cool if I meet the third guy (his friend who I never met). And basically he just says yeah we can all meet up sometime before signing any leases, so I was chill and asked him regularly for updates because at this point I was hoping to finalize something by the end of November. By the end of the month he’s still “talking with the other guy,” and planning stuff. At this point, I’m not even asking too much so much as he’s giving me updates and asking if I’m still in.

Flash forward, by the end of winter break, I fly back in ( a few days late cuz I got Covid and had to stay home). I’m surprised with his girlfriend there. She’s staying the whole week and he never asked me because “he forgot” and didn’t realize I never was asked. I let it slide cuz at that point I just couldn’t do anything and didn’t wanna start anything.

That same day, he asks if I’m still good for the apartment, I say yes (really rethinking my plans), but I’ve got no other options At this point so I move on and we are still planning on rooming.

NOW, not even a week later I start hearing things which make me confused. (For context I wear noise canceling headphones and usually tune out whatever he says on the phone, but when I hear my name I tend to notice (cocktail party effect)). I hear him say that me and him were planning on housing next year, but “we just forgot over time so we aren’t really doing that anymore”. I was shocked to hear this, he approached me and we were still set to house at that point. I ask him later that day (as to not make him think I’m listening in on his conversations like a creep), and he says yeah “we’re still good just waiting on more stuff from the third guy”.

Fast forward two days later (Friday), and I hear him mention how he’s already working on a leasing contract, I’ve heard nothing of this and ask him what’s going on, he says “my dad neeeded an example contract” or some BS. At this point I realize he’s been planning out an other arrangement with a whole different group and just didn’t tell me. Now today I’ve received confirmation as i heard him mention the depositi has been placed when he talked to his mom.

Just to test  him I asked what’s going on, and same BS, “still waiting on guy 3” but this 
time he says he’s not sure if this is going to work 100% and to not turn down any other offers I get.

I’m so upset rn and don’t know what to do. Obviously I need to find other housing and will get on that asap, but I really wanna chew him out and don’t know the best way (been more conservative in college and don’t just impulsively do things like in high school).

Any advice? (Still need to see this bots face for 3 months)

2717,looking for like minded people,"I'll keep this short: I've found the LGBT spaces and groups on campus to be very alienating, and the reason comes at no surprise- it's incredibly politicized. And being politicized wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if it was welcoming of different political values and ideas, except it's just one big liberal bubble. 

So anyone like myself, who isn't liberal, feels ostracized. From a space that was apparently meant for me? 

Some background info: I've grown up liberal. I've been a liberal until very recently. And I've been involved with  these lgbt groups so I'm very familiar with their values and how they operate. I've been more into revolutionary politics in recent years and found myself disagreeing with many liberal political strategies and ideals and this is where the problem comes. Apparently ""dissent"" translates to ""violent aggressor"" in these spaces so I'm not welcome. neither is anyone else who dares to be themselves and speaks of their values.

 (If you want an example, last semester a freshman gay person made a post on reddit expressing similar discomfort with ideological issues and people came at him pretty hard. Poor guy had to delete his post and his account) some of the things I and many of my friends have discomfort with is the heavy language policing, identity politics, and dominance of postmodern ideologies. 

This shouldn't be the case. If it's an LGBT space, it should be for LGBT people, regardless of their political values. Gay Republicans, lesbian libertarians, trans Republicans, bisexual socialists- it shouldn't matter. 

But unfortunately it does, and that's very disappointing and frustrating. I want to know if other homosexual or transsexual people have felt similarly.

Lately, and this could be something wrong with Windows 10 saving application cache data or something else that's random, but I've been having to sign in to Photoshop every single time I open it, and whenever I sign in, I sign in with my university credentials (it prompts you to our typical U of M login with our uniqID and password and then has you two-factor authenticate) and every time I click ""Remember me for 7 days"" it never remembers me. To top it off, every time I open an image file in Photoshop, it will open it (as normal) and crash within seconds. I think it might not even be crashing, but maybe auto-closing as a safety feature for people who try to pirate the software or share accounts, so whenever it logs me out, it likely auto-closes Photoshop.

I have no clue why this is happening. At first I thought that I might need to update Photoshop, so I opened Creative Cloud just to learn that I also have to sign in again every time I open Creative Cloud. Anyone have any ideas?

2795,Fuck mdining,"This is literally just a rant, nothing else. I've been working for Mdining consistently since 2018. I was hired at $10, and through their system of giving 25¢ raises a semester was at $11 by the time covid hit. Last year was sporadic and I switched locations a ton based on who was open, and I didn't get any raises due to the wage freeze, which I didn't love but at least understood. I didn't plan on coming back this year, but my manager asked if I'd at least come help train the new people, which I agreed to. I ended up just staying on the schedule, and decided I might as well finish my time at college at the same place I started.

Halfway through last semester, I found out everyone had gotten a dollar raise, bumping the starting pay up to 11, with all the ""experienced"" people making more. I hadn't gotten the raise. When I complained to my manager she said something about how because I was technically just there to train I'd been ""lost in the shuffle."" I complained some more and eventually got bumped up to $12, with about two weeks of back pay at this rate. This is still lower than most places on campus, of course, but it tracks for this location at least. 

I finally turned in my two week notice and had my last shift today. During this shift I was talking with the new guy (hired two weeks ago, essentially my replacement), and found out he was also making $12. Apparently they bumped starting pay up another dollar this semester while leaving everyone else's pay the same. I get that they're trying to get more employees, but my manager keeps complaining about high turnover and seems to have no idea why it's happening. I'm glad they're finally raising starting pay this year (although it's still way too little), but is my four years of experience worth nothing? I'm good enough to train new people but not get paid any more than them? I had to walk the student manager through her job today knowing I'm making $2 less than her, despite her starting last semester. I was the oldest/most experienced employee at the location and asked to be promoted multiple times, but whatever. I don't know. I'm glad some people are making more, just wish I was too. I'm considering emailing my (now ex) manager asking about back pay but I doubt anything will come from it.

2799,Consequences of W on transcript,"Note: I am in LS&A

I dual enrolled Calc 3 in high school.  Only come Winter registration and the registration site tells me I'm missing my MATH215 prerequisite.  It turns out that Michigan erroneously put it on my transcript as something called ""Math 201X"" which is like a departmental credit.  This seemed wrong to me because the transfer credit website said it (Math 240 from Schoolcraft College) transfers as MATH215.  Anyways, after a bunch of back and forth I finally get an email from the math transfer credit people telling me it's accepted.  The only problem is that I got that email today (I emailed last Thursday), a day after the drop deadline.  So obviously I do not want to take MATH215 any more because I already will have the credits for it.  I know you can get a late drop without a GPA penalty as long as its approved but the website seems to show it will marked as a ""W"" with basically no exceptions.  Is there any actual consequences to this?  I don't even know what it would look like on my transcript.  Would there be a MATH215 (W) under Undergraduate LS&A and then under transfer courses be a regular MATH215?  Would this negatively effect me in any way?  I emailed my counselor about it but people here never respond to their emails very quickly which makes me think I should just submit the late drop request now and try to get the W removed later.",5,2,uofm,new

""Class"" of 2017 here.

Despite walking at graduation, I never graduated. Some shitty stuff happened to me my senior year and I kind of just tanked mentally which lead to not graduating. I took an extra semester (was on a full scholarship and had to pay full out of state), and came in two classes shy of graduating. I'm still in good standing with a perfectly acceptable GPA etc.

I started a successful company in 2018 and never looked back and the aim to graduate kind of just passed me by.

The recent college football run kind of opened my eyes to how much trauma there is between me and Michigan, cause I had a hard time pretending I cared after being a die-hard fan the 4.5 years I spent in Ann Arbor.

I want to do my last couple classes and get my damn diploma. If not for me, for my parents (I was on a full scholarship but that doesn't mean they care any less about the fact that I don't have a diploma).

I have a really hard time mentally getting back into communicating with UMich and reopening this trauma. I'm basically looking for a current student (bonus points if you're in the School of Kinesiology) to help me navigate what exactly I have to do, who I need to speak to, and what classes I can take to make this happen. I'll pay you $500, $250 upfront and $250 once I finish the classes. I'm sort of a public figure so I can't screw you over or you can cancel me lol.

do you guys have any tips of surviving a course like this? it’s a breadth class for my major and i can’t really afford to take it another semester but i’m honestly terrified of not understanding the content because of the people teaching the class.

It is important to remember that Marschall was hired by Schlissel to radically downsize the Michigan medical system.  Marschall outsourced this effort to Mulholland.  This has resulted in dramatic discontent amongst faculty and staff because toxic leadership creates a toxic work environment.   Patients have suffered as a result.  This started several years before Covid.

Make no mistake, Marschall is a Schlissel man.  

Now Marschall is distancing himself from Schlissel.

The system and it's patients cannot heal until Marschall and the people he has placed in power are gone.  The sooner this happens, the more quickly we can put the Schlissel disaster behind us.

2893,Korean/English Language Exchange study,"Hi All,

Hi, my name is William and I am currently a student at the University of Michigan. I wanted to start studying English in earnest and found out that there is a Conversation Partner Program offered by the University (https://conversation-partners.lrc.lsa.umich.edu//records.php?lang=English). However, I couldn't find any Language Exchange group at UofM.

Recently, I tried to find a native/advanced English student who wants to learn Korean. At the same time, I would love to teach Korean (as my native language) who wants to learn Korean/interested in learning Korean (a kind of language exchange study). 

One of the possible ways to study language is that I am going to talk using English while you talk with Korean (or vice versa). Also, we teach/correct language skills (e.g., intonation, accent, grammar, and so on), which helps us a lot to be sounded more native. In addition to those, any kind of study is very welcome! 

To explain myself, I came to the US 4 years ago and my native language is Korean (English level is Intermediate)
My hobbies are playing the piano/Tennis.

2904,About F1 visa students' opportunities of working in the U.S.,"I'm a computer science major and I've noticed during my interviews with companies that many companies are looking for interns who want to stay and work full time but they don't offer h1b sponsorship afterward, so they almost completely disregard f1 students even before the interviews.

What makes me really confused is that it is difficult to find an intern in a big tech that can offer H1B in the future without having any internship experience. But small start-ups usually can't let me in to just gain experience because they are actually aiming at a future full-time worker and most of them can't offer us international students h1b to work full time in the future. So they won't consider us in the first place. That seems a dilemma for us.

Could someone please offer me some advice for international students to find their first internship? Thank you in advance!",12,0,uofm,new

2913,Questions about Transfer life and worries!,"Hi everyone, I am a current freshman at MSU hoping to transfer into UofM. While I absolutely love MSU, I really don't feel academically challenged as much and the some parts of the life here aren't really what I'm looking for. I am curious about a few things and I hope you guys can give me a hand :)  


1. Joining clubs as a sophomore. How easy is it? I have heard a lot of things in this sub relating to transfers having a really hard time getting into clubs so I am a bit nervous! Extracurriculars are a huge thing for me.
2. Transfer Credit. Thankfully, my credits all transfer in but do you all think it might be worth retaking a class. I am taking an intro CS class at MSU and I feel like I am not really learning much since the class is really terribly put together. I also fear I may have not taken the right writing course that can transfer over (I am taking it at LCC and it may be the wrong section lol) so would I be able to possibly take it over summer or would it just be worth it to take it at UofM/at WCC concurrently at UofM?
3. The big one. So, during covid 2020-2021 (grad year) I had a string of really bad things in my family happen and the loss of reliable income/stability in my family. My grades overall suffered greatly as I went from a rising 3.8ish to a 3.6 in just 3 semesters. I had to move online my second semester of my senior year to take care of my grandma and help my mom. This was by-far my worst academically I've done and my mental health was near 0. Fall semester of college I managed to get a solid 4.0 and land some good positions in clubs and got an internship. How much will they look at the really bad grades in senior year of high school? Is my rebound a factor that will kinda lessen the blow of that? How would I include that to better fit in my resume?
4. The side one. I didn't apply to UofM-Ann Arbor but I did apply to UofM-Dearborn (and got in) because I initially wanted to go there if I felt like I didn't get into OSU or MSU (which were my top schools).  Does that count as applying to UofM even though it wasn't to the flagship campus? (I only ask because on the transfer app it says to put down if you applied to UofM; sorry for the dumb question ahaha)
5. The side side one. Are the squirrels still really fat?

Thank you all! Even if I don't get in I will try again my sophomore semester! Even if that fails I'll just get my masters here ahahaha. I have a deep admiration for UofM as the idea of ""leaders and the best"" kinda resonated with me (as well as spending half of my childhood in A2). Regardless, this is a really really long post and I appreciate you for reading it!  Blue-Green solidarity.",12,1,uofm,new

It seems like 99% of the people here are naturally attractive and/or put full effort into their appearance every day. I'm constantly surrounded by people looking their best, and it makes me feel like I need to do the same. I spent at least 20 minutes this morning deciding on an outfit because everything I put on felt too basic or unflattering. I feel ugly compared to everyone else here, and I worry that people won't like me if I don't look presentable enough. Realistically I know that isn't the case, but the thoughts still cross my mind. It's hard to not feel self-conscious here.

Not to mention, I just started here and I'm still trying to establish a routine. I live off-campus so I do a lot of walking, but I've been struggling to eat enough because of time. Between those things, I think I'm losing weight and my clothes are starting to not fit. So not only do I hardly own stuff that is deemed presentable here, but the clothes I do like don't fit anymore.

2935,Data Science Major for the hell of it???,"So here's my situation. I'm currently a senior and should be graduating at the end of this semester. However, due to changing my major a little late, some health issues I ran into last year, and my pure loathing for online classes, I'm going to need to take another full year. Two extra semesters. 

I am currently double majoring in Actuarial Mathematics and Statistics. It was towards the end of sophomore year (right around the time COVID hit) that I decided a Data Science major wasn't for me, so I switched to Actuarial Mathematics. Kept the Statistics--she's been with me from the start. 

Anyway, here I am screwing around with my class schedules and graduation requirements and I notice that I would literally only have to take TWO extra classes in order to get a DS degree. There's so much overlap between the three (Actuarial, Stats, DS) that courses I've already taken basically completely cover all of the electives and even the Capstone course for Data Science. I would only need to take EECS 281 and then either EECS 484 OR EECS 485 (plus all the other courses I was already planning on taking for my other majors) in order to fulfill my major requirements for DS

I'd be crazy not to, right? I've mapped out my next two semesters and it would just end up being 4 classes per semester, total. So, after this semester ends, I could be 8 classes away from a BS in Actuarial mathematics, statistics, and data science.

Now, I must add, the primary reason I dropped DS in the first place was because I wasn't particularly fond of 280. A big part of that was definitely remote learning though. I feel like if I go into 281 with a no-bullshit attitude and actually take the time to learn and study the material, I can do well. 

I guess I'm just looking for your guys' thoughts, especially considering most of ya'll are EECS students. Is a triple major even possible? Worth it? Would I be better off doing a CS minor instead of a DS major? Or just stick with my current track which is Acturial math + Stats double major and no minor. I meet with my academic advisor soon too, so hopefully he will be able to guide me in the right direction.
